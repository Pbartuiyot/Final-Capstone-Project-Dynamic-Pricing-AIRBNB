        "Airbnb hosts in Boston struggle to attract guests due to poor pricing, limited visibility, and listings that don't highlight local attractions or unique features. Without proper data analytics, many set prices that are either too high, driving away bookings, or too low, hurting profitability. This limits Airbnb’s growth and undermines local economic benefits while missing opportunities to promote Boston cultural heritage. Unlike hotels that rely on brand recognition, Airbnb guests depend on user reviews and listing details to gauge value, often willing to pay more for well-rated properties. However, hosts don’t have clear guidance on which features, like location, amenities, or host responsiveness, affect guest satisfaction and pricing.\n",
        "Boston. By analyzing reviews, proximity to attractions, seasonal demand, and host service quality, we will extract key insights. Natural language processing (NLP) will help identify what guests value, their expectations, and improvement areas. This will enable hosts to set competitive prices that balance occupancy and profitability. - Improve listing quality based on guest preferences. Increase visibility by showcasing unique features and local attractions."

The rooms were great: really comfortable beds and towels for each guest. \\r\\nWe had a little problem with the heating system but Shawn was really responsive and fixed the problem really quickly! \\r\\nSo thank you Shawn, my friends and I really enjoyed our stay in Boston and your apartment was a big part of it! Will definitely recommend this place and come back if ever in the area! :)\""

            "- This modern apartment was lovely with plenty of room and all the facilities you need. There were six of us staying so there was plenty of room with the two bedrooms and the third bedroom which is a mezzanine type set up above the lounge and beside the rooftop deck....the rooftop deck is ideal for drinks and a barbecue on a nice summers evening. The area is nice - we felt really safe walking around at night and there was a lovely park directly opposite where we watched the baseball teams play each night. Restaurants and a good supermarket are within close walking distance.  Dan was an excellent communicator, we always received an instant response and he was very friendly.\n",
            "- The apartment was very nice. Communication with property owner was great. GPS might take to you a nearby location so be sure to map yourself to the right address beforehand. \n",
            "- Dan's place was fantastic!! 5 stars\n",
            "Spacious, clean, modern, great location, parking. Couldn't ask for more.\n",
            "- The host made us feel very welcome. The neighborhood was a great spot to get anywhere in Boston. The home was extremely clean and very nice. We visited in July and especially enjoyed the rooftop patio. Would definitely stay again!\n",
            "- Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Dan en personne. Mais il était très accueillant par message interposé, et très disponible pour répondre à nos demandes. Son appartement est tout simplement magnifique à tout point de vue : confort, équipement, propreté. Et la disponibilité d'un parking dédié à l'appartement est un vrai plus quand on est en voiture. Nous reviendrons avec plaisir.\n",
            "- From the beginning of the process the host was very involved in making us feel welcome and getting comfortable in the property.  Provided fantastic detailed reminders with amenities in the area to help us on our first trip to Boston.  Were easily accessible via text & email and helped us work through everything we needed.  Would absolutely recommend this listing & location!\n",
            "- Ein großes Appartment mit Charme, aber leider nur für 4 Personen richtig gut geeignet, da z.B. nicht genügend Stühle vorhanden sind bzw. auch Tische in der richtigen Größe fehlen (auf der Terrasse). Zudem fehlen einige praktische Dinge wie Abstellmöglichkeiten und Leselicht an den Betten. \n",
            "- Great spot.  Dan was very helpful with telling us about places to go and do.  House was very clean and exactly what the pictures showed.  Would def stay again.  \n",
            "- The listing was accurate other than 3rd bedroom.  The photo shows it as a couch, but there are two beds in this room.  Also should note the unit is on the 6th floor with stair access only. \n",
            "\n",
            "Loved the location and the roof top deck, great for families. \n",
            "- Yes, we felt welcome, the place was immaculate and in a great location.  We'd definitely stay here the next time in Boston.\n",
            "- L appartement est conforme aux photos spacieux bien équipé,très propre.\n",
            "Tout près du centre de Boston en bus.\n",
            "Dommage qu il soit si bruyant ( avion ,et camion en semaine).\n",
            "Et il se trouve au 3 ème sans ascenseur.\n",
            "Nous y avons passé un bon séjour.\n",
            "\n",
            "- The apartment was very well located in the lovely Beacon Hill area. It was close to interesting boutique shops, a variety of restaurants and several small food stores. It was a short walk to either the red or green subway lines and access to other parts of the city was easy, either by train or walking. The apartment is a studio, with bed, sitting area and kitchen included in the one space, but it is more than adequate for two people. We enjoyed the ambience of the apartment and its location.\n",
            "- Great compact studio in a fantastic location surrounded by great shops, diners, restaurants and 2 mins walk from the public park and Boston Common. Everything you need for a short stay in Boston. No laundry facilities in the building but Charles St launderette within a minute's walk.\n",
            "- The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- Good communication and easy to follow instructions. Unbeatable location, perfect for those who like the inner city vibe. Very responsive to questions and requests. You'll need to bring or buy cooking and bath basics if you are staying a while.\n",
            "- Great location right off of Charles St. with tons of coffee places and restaurants (try the pizza at Figs!) and the Boston commons right around the corner. Parking at Boston Commons was VERY expensive, but it is the closest lot. All parking along the street is metered (not overnight) or permit parking only. I didn't cook in the apartment, as we were only there for a few days, but everything was clean and exactly as pictured. The AC worked well and kept us cool at night. This was everything I could ask for for our short stay. Due to the superb location and reasonable price, I would definitely consider staying here again for my next visit to downtown Boston!\n",
            "- The apartment was just as we expected.  The location was perfect, the bed, sheets, and the amenities were very good.  The Wifi was fast and reliable.\n",
            "- We had a great stay at Cityview Longwood apartments. The apartment is spacious and comfortable and was very clean . We needed a few extra supplies (plates, cutlery and glasses) and these were delivered the same day. The gym is sufficiently equipped and is availabe 24/7 as is the laundry room in the basement.\n",
            "The building's population consists of mostly young students and is very friendly and well-behaved. We had a wonderful view towards the Boston skyline and looking southeast we could see the bay of Boston in the distance. We cycled into central Boston and nearby charming neighborhoods like Longwood and Brookline within half an hour. The apartment is walking distance to the Museum of Fine ARt. The Hubway bikeshare scheme is very convenient and Hubway stations are nearby. The Green Line into town is also very close and dependable. For basic needs there is a large supermarkt at a 5 min walk as well as a few restaurants and pharmacies.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Mike was very helpful in my search for a place to stay last minute in Boston.  Very easy check in/out process.  Very enjoyable experience.\n",
            "- Its a nice little room - neat and clean. Joe is a great host- He is prompt in his responses and he will help you with any local information. \n",
            "- This was basic space, a bit tight and no amenities,  but it met our needs, maybe a little high priced for what it is.  The people coming in late thumped their suitcases up the stairs at midnight which was right outside our room. \n",
            "The parking could have been a problem, three cars in one long driveway, but it worked out ok.Joe was prompt in communicating.\n",
            "- Joe was very fast in responding. He was very flexible on the check in time. He made sure we could park our car somewhere and that we had everything we needed. The only setback was the bathroom. The smell was a little hard to handle, but other than that, the place was fine for a quick one-night stay. The pictures are an accurate depiction of the place. \n",
            "- Very simple and easy stay.  The room was quite clean.  \n",
            "- We had a Great stay at Joes place!\n",
            "- Joe offered a comfortable, clean place to stay for a few nights before my girlfriend and I moved in to our own apartment. Pros include clear arrival directions , clean bed, sheets, parking space (!) bathroom. Joe was easy to communicate and accommodating, even though we did not meet in person. Photos matched the room. For improvement, I would suggest being more clear on communicating the set-up of the apartment, as we were surprised there were several other guests, not us and host only. Also, if there are more than one guest parking in car port, that would be helpful to know, as we were blocked in around check-out. It was resolved shortly, luckily, but felt bad other guys had to wake up to move their car. Joes place is great if you need a place to stay for a short amount of time. Those looking for a local Boston area experience might look elsewhere.\n",
            "- The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- The listing was very accurate and Jessica was accommodating and great to work with! I would highly recommend staying at her AirBNB for any small parties looking to spend time in Boston. \n",
            "- Jessica was the perfect host! Her place was very clean and really well decorated. It's in a perfect location, across from a park and an easy walk from Copley Square and 2 subway lines.\n",
            "\n",

            "- This was a great house for our stay in Boston! The area, Jamaica Plains, is a great location- you can easily walk to several great restaurants & the Sam Adams brewery. The T was only a couple of blocks away & then it was only a 10 min ride to the center of Boston. The house was comfortable & updated. We got to meet the host upon arriving & she was great! The communication was the best I've ever had through the booking & rental process and I've rented a lot of places. There is a cat on property, Earl Gray, who is so friendly & awesome to have around. All in all, a great experience- I highly recommend staying here! \n",

            "- This house in a quiet neighborhood was perfect for our family's first trip to Boston. It was immaculately clean with plush towels, very comfortable beds, pillows and linens. It was totally up to date with wifi, A/C and stainless steel appliances. Nice, full bath upstairs with a good shower, double sink and tile floor. Half bath on the main floor. Washer and dryer were available for us to use, although we didn't need it. It's an easy, short walk to the Transit station and only a 10 min. ride to downtown Boston. My son played some pick up games of basketball in the nice park right across the street. A very friendly cat lives on the premises. I appreciated the good communication with the host, Liesl, who seemed to really care that our stay at her home and in Boston was enjoyable.  Thanks Leisl.\n",
            "- Great location, walking distance to so many of the touristy things in boston.   Kristin was friendly and helpful!  I messages her a few times during our stay and she responded quickly.  Bedding and towels were clean and the apartment was homey and comfortable.  \n",

            "It took us about 30 min to go to downtown Boston (10 min walk and 20 min tram ride), which was ok as tram goes at least every 10 minutes - even in the evenings. You can take a Bus instead of walking, as it stops nearby their house - unfortunately we could hear buses going by from our bedroom, so it is not really quiet.\n",

            "But all in all, we recommend staying in this private room as Lisa really is a helpful and nice host, you get to downtown easily and the room was really affordable...\n",
            "- We were very impressed with Lisa and Brian's house. Their house is about 10 minutes walk from the T station Forest Hill, so no big deal. They were laid-back and friendly hosts, quiet but willing to chat and recommend stuff. Our room was clean and nicely decorated (the Rustic Room), the bedding was clean and comfy, Wifi worked well. The room had good blackout curtains. We loved the little extra touches: Bonbons on our towels, a nice basket full of sweet and savoury snacks, water bottles and even freshly baked cookies! They even provide free Metro/bus passes for the duration of your stay! My husband had a shower and reported that the shower was a fancy spa shower and the water pressure was good. There are two bathrooms to share in the house between maybe 5 double bedrooms, but this was not a problem, no waiting time. Nice and clean. Breakfast was great. Lisa was not fussy about what time we had breakfast, it was all laid out and waiting for whenever we wanted it: boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereals, orange juice, a fancy coffee machine with all kinds of coffee and tea options, muffins, toast, milk, apples and bananas, cream cheese, crumpets and more I can't remember now. There was a living room with a film projector, but we didn't use this as we were busy running around Boston. We loved this place!\n",
            "- I'm gonna line up with the thousand of good comments Lisa and Brian already have. They deserve such gratitude ! Going to their home is being treated like in a 5 stars hotel : treats on your pillow, home made cookies, their home is yours. It's uncredible to find such a place at this price and location (less than 10min to the orange line, a giant very affordable store on the way). We've only stayed one night but we weren't neglected at all ! I really recommand it to any of you who come to Boston !\n",
            "\n",
            "Je me range du côté de ces commentaires positifs que Lisa et Brian ont déjà reçu : ils les méritent grandement ! En allant chez eux, attendez vous à du haut standing : friandises sur l'oreiller, cookies fait maison, vous vous sentirez chez vous. Ça semble incroyable de trouver une chambre à ce prix et si bien située (moins de 10min à pied du métro avec un très bon et très grand supermarché sur le chemin). Ils nous ont parfaitement accueilli alors qu'on ne restait qu'une courte nuit chez eux ! Je les recommande vivement à tous les visiteurs de Boston !\n",
            "- From the moment we arrived Lisa and Brian made us feel very welcome and at home. We were given a tour of the house and given advice on where to go to eat that evening (an excellent recommendation - (URL HIDDEN) and how to get to Boston the following morning. \n",

            "- Lisa was very gracious and helpful. She shared information, willingly, suggested places to see and how to get there, favorite eating places, directions, etc. We needed to add an extra night at the front end of our stay and she accommodated this. The rooms are clean with a home-like feel. Very welcoming and comfortable.\n",
            "- The stay at Lisa's house was absolutely amazing! As we arrived in Boston via a night bus, we got to Lisa's place quite early but we were greeted with a lovely breakfast and were able to check in immediately. Every morning, Lisa sat with us at the breakfast table and was more than willing to give us tips to do in Boston. We followed a lot of her advises and had a great time. Everything was clean, the breakfast was really nice (muffins, toasts, fruits, coffee) and we even had some fresh baked cookies in our room! The free subway pass was also really helpful and we saved a lot of money through this. Although Roslindale is not in the center of Boston, getting downtown was really no problem as the subway station was quite close. Whenever we had a question, Lisa was always there to help us. Lisa, thank you so much for welcoming us into your home!\n",
            "- It's a very happy experience for us to stay at Lisa's Rustic Room for two days. Lisa is so nice and always helpful. It is so convenient to go to the downtown of Boston. We bring our 2yr old baby girl, Lisa is so kind to provide a baby cot to us. Next time when I go to Boston, I will choose Lisa's room again. Thanks to Lisa!\n",
            "- Nice flat and confortable bed. The included breakfast and the attentions in the bedroom mad the stay more enjoyable. Thanks Lisa\n",
            "- Leider waren wir nur kurz in Boston ( 1 Nacht) , haben die Zeit aber sehr genossen. Lisa hat uns bei allen Fragen weitergeholfen und unterstützt. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt bei den Beiden und würden jederzeit wiederkommen. Schade das wir uns nur kurz kennengelernt haben. \n",
            "- Lisa was great! She was very nice and accommodating! Everything we'd hope for in an Airbnb host! The place was nice. Good, clean room. Amenities (bathroom, guest kitchen, etc.) were all great. The neighborhood was fine too. Felt perfectly safe. It was just a quick 10 minute (max) walk to the nearest subway stop. All in all, we would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Boston!\n",
            "- Lisa was very helpfull and friendly for everything. She also picked us by her car when we lost our way :)\n",
            "- Lisa is a great host! She provided useful tour information about Boston and loved to share her life or opinions with us! We are just like friends! Her home is just like my home:) We have everything we need! TKS! Also, the public transportation is easy! There is a bus stop just across her house's street and you could take metro after 2 stops of the bus! Lisa is sweet to provide free passes for bus or metro! You don't need to worry about the fare about the bus or metro! Thanks! Just come to stay:)\n",
            "- We were so lucky to have our first AirBnB experience here with Lisa and Brian. The private room was cozy (heated blanket, fresh sheets) with sweet touches (snacks, cookies). The shared amenities (kitchen, bathroom) had everything we needed and more, and the transit passes were a great convenience. Moreover, these two were so generous in answering to my last minute needs; everything from printing papers to cooking ingredients.\n",
            "Definitely a commendable BnB :)\n",
            "- Lisa was the perfect host. This was my first experience using airbnb or anything similar to hotels and alternatives. If my future experiences are like the one I had while staying at Lisa's, then I'll confidently say that there is no need for a hotel. Location was perfect, 10 min walk from station, value was incredible, and everything was super clean. The bed was sooooo comfortable, the popcorn and netflix through projector were great, the breakfast was amaaaaaaaazing! Plenty of board games. It really felt like staying at home, better even. Lisa was really nice, helpful,  friendly, flexible (especially with arrival/departure times),  and personable. She made sure our every need was met, while giving us a perfect amount of space. I wish we could have stayed more thab one night. If I had to stay in boston again, Lisa's will definitely be the first choice. If I could give more than five stars, I would. Thanks Lisa (and Brian!).\n",
            "I hope this COMPLETELY honest review helps future bookers.\n",
            "- I had a good experience with the Rustic room, which has a great bed with an electric blanket.  There are three other rooms for rent in the house, so guests share their own kitchen, which is stocked with cereal, muffins, eggs, coffee and tea.  There are two bathrooms for four rooms, so you share with one other room. Lisa was very nice and accommodating, and there is even free popcorn and Netflix in the living room.  Upstairs there is a dining room table with lots of pamphlets and some books about Boston and New England.  But I would say the best added value is the unlimited subway and bus pass that each guest receives, which saves you a bundle.  This makes the room an even better value.  \n",
            "- First time using Airbnb and it was delightful. Got to the Host house and Lisa was there to give us a tour of the house. Was accommodated with two Charlie passes that covered public transportation through Boston. If all Airbnb's is like Lisa's House then I will certainly be using this instead of Hotels.\n",
            "- We stayed at two rooms during our stay. For a detalied description look at the sportsroom one.\n",
            "- First time AirBNB experience, and we were a bit anxious about both the unfamiliar city and the service. We feel fortunate to have run into Lisa. She was very cordial and responsive from the start. We arrived quite late into the day, where most of the tourist spots were closed. It wasn't too productive trying to sightsee after 4pm, and we only planned a night of stay. Seeing how the included unlimited metro card could save us a lot of trouble and money (parking around Boston can get problematic and expensive), I asked Lisa for possibility of using it even after we check out the next day. She agreed, and honestly it made a huge difference in our efficiency and convenience. We couldn't have covered the places we did with a car or park-and-walk, and using the T would have become pretty expensive. \n",
            "\n",
            "We changed room upon arrival (from sports room to rustic, for no other reason than because my girlfriend liked it better). The four rooms are in the same building, two on each floor. It shows different locations on Airbnb so it's a bit confusing. The location is two bus stops away from the end of orange line (Forest Hills), and there are many buses that would take you to the station so the wait was never long. Parking is off the street. The bed is really comfortable, and heating pads and blankets are provided for great comfort. Cable TV is in every room, as well as WiFi. There's a bathroom on each floor (one for two rooms), and a full kitchen that we could use to prepare our own meals with the things in the fridge. It's very flexible and accommodating. There were all these little touches that showed a caring host, and it's comforting to know.\n",

            "- I arrived there, got shown around and explained everything. The bedroom was big and the bed comfortable. The complementary cookies were awesome and the breakfast only lacked jelly/jam. I basically only slept there and didn't interact much with anybody. The access to store and public transit is perfect.\n",
            "- Lisa was great! Very accommodating. We had zero problems. The subway card was awesome! We put it to good use! Nice place! Heated blankets. She had tea and coffee for us and lots of board games! We wish we got to play some board games with you! Would stay again. 10/10 recommend. \n",
            "- Lisa and Brian are very friendly and kind. The price of the house is very worthy. The bed is big and the bathroom is clean. We can cook anything we want in the kitchen and watch movies by projector in the living room. The house is close to bus stations and subway station. Hence, it's very convenient and safe. It would be my highly recommended house when visiting Boston. Very good experience.\n",
            "- Lisa was a very helpful and careful host. The apartment is very cool, clean and pretty close to the subway or the bus. 5 min on walk to get the orange line, what's do you want more ?

            "- Lisa's house is very good and comfortable. I enjoy the time to live there. The house seems far away from downtown, but the bus and subway is very convenient. The free pass do us a great favor! Cakes for breakfast is delicious. I like everything in your room! I'll live in your house again if I go to Boston. :)\n",
            "- Lisa is a great host and extremely understanding. We arrived their place after midnight on a Saturday and she was kind enough to wait for us. The place felt just like home. The breakfast was so fulfilling with well stocked items such as bagels with cream cheese, bread and jam, eggs, Keurig style coffee machine, tea, muffins, fresh fruits...etc. last but least, the complimentary Charlie card is so useful if you are like us tourists who want to explore throughout Boston during your stay not to mention $$$saved. Thank you Lisa and your husband for making our stay in Boston so comfortable and feeling of home away from home. God bless! :))\n",
            "- Lisa was awesome....though our stay was brief she made us feel like we were home...We would definitely stay there again!! \n",
            "- First of all, prior to arrival Lisa sent us all the information we needed, so our trip was off to a good start! When we arrived, there was plenty of free parking on the street, and we were greeted by Brian (Lisa's Husband). He gave us a tour of the place, and explained all information. He was very friendly and made us feel comfortable and welcome. The room, had a couple of snacks, bottles of water and an information sheet with wifi code and other appreciated information...! The two public transportation cards were also available when we arrived (very fun to have!) The bus stop is right across the street! The bed is VERY comfortable.. (usually, I miss my bed, but I didn't this time!) The heating blanket, with controls on each side of the bed is AMAZING. We eventually got to meet Lisa, she was so friendly and happy , it put us in a good mood. They kindly let us play some of their board games ( an awesome selection) and even invited us to play with them later that evening but we were unfortunately busy! The place is very clean, and everything was great. Will be staying again when back in Boston! You won't regret your stay. PS: the breakfast offered is good and a really cool idea , loved it ! Especially the hot apple cider for the Kureg machine.... \n",

Both were very friendly, and I wish I had more time to chat and get to know them. Highly doubt this is my last stay. Fantastic neighborhood. I walked around in super cold weather, but never felt threatened.\n",

            "- Lisa was very friendly and accommodating. The room is just as cute and clean as in the picture, plus the house has many perks (projector to watch movie, free breakfast!). Also, the bus stop is right in front of her house and the subway station is walking distance, which was really convenient! It was great staying with Lisa and I'll definitely come back if I visit Boston again.\n",

Lisa was very accommodating and even communicated well with me when the Charlie passes were malfunctioning for a moment. I would definitely come back to stay here again! Thanks Lisa and Brian!\n",

Because we arrived a few hours before check-in, she graciously allowed us to drop off our bags so we could enjoy Boston without all the extra weight!

Thank you, Lisa and Brain!\n",
            "- Todo fue según lo pactado. Lisa es una gran anfitriona, tal cual los comentarios previos. Si bien solo estuve una noche me permitió dejar las cosas y pasarlas a buscar luego. Buen desayuno, todo muy limpio y ordenado. Si bien es algo lejos ellos te proveen los pases del subte, los cuales de otra manera son bastante caros. En fin, una buena experiencia en mi primer viaje con AirBNB. \n",

Lisa est charmante et est prête à répondre à toutes nos questions et fournir tous les renseignements touristiques. L'accès à la cuisine est libre et elle nous a gentiment offert le petit déjeuner. Le pass des transports edt très appréciable et simplifie la vie. La maison est dans un quartier calme et très bien desservie par les transports.

They were flexible and easygoing and it's clear to see that they are committed to delivering a hassle-free experience for their guests. They are both interesting and easy to talk to, and Lisa even made us cookies one night!\n",
            "We couldn't have been happier with our choice to stay with them and 100% recommend their place if you're coming to Boston!\n",
            "- Really easy experience overall. The house is two levels. First level has the projector, Boston room, Rustic room and purple bathroom and the second has the kitchen, orange bathroom, sports themed room, and nautical room.  The location was great, the room was comfortable,  and the extras like breakfast and transit passes were a big plus.  Lisa and Brian are very friendly and  helpful. We rarely ran into the other guests or felt crowded in the house and there were no shared bathroom issues at all.  Glad i booked it!\n",
            "- It was an awesome experience with Lisa in Boston. Friendly and most considerate host I ever saw.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Jess and I had wonderful time at Lisa and Brian's place. The Charlie Card was a huge help for getting around town on public transportation. The bed was so comfortable. The food was delicious also with the cookies, muffins and coffee. Thanks for a great stay you two!\n",
            "- Lisa is so lovely. I felt like visiting a friend. She helped me with anything I needed. It was easy to park the car in front of the house. The house is really nice. My bed was super comfortable. I loved the rustic room. It was nice to meet other travelers in the house. I enjoyed having the free metro ticket. My time in Boston was so great. Thanks for everything. I highly recommend Lisa and her place. \n",

            "Breakfast is a good selection - toast, muffins, cereals and porridge as well as omelettes (if you feel like cooking).\n",
            "The local area is quite but there is a fantastic restaurant called Dogwood just opposite the station, definitely recommend the chicken under a brick, santa fe salad and juicy lucy burger. Otherwise it's really easy to get into town- just hop on the t-line for a few stops with the Charlie Cards that Lisa and Brian kindly provided.\n",
            "Excellent hosts, lovely room and great location- we would definitely stay again!\n",
            "- This is easily the best AirBnB experience I've had. Lisa was an amazing host who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. The entire place is very tastefully designed, the unlimited passes are a definite plus where the public transport network is so extensive and the bus stop is located just right outside her house, which makes getting to downtown very convenient. I strongly recommend her place to everyone and I'm definitely staying here again the next time I visit Boston.\n",
            "- This place was perfect for me and my small family. Two things made our stay especially special: 1) Lisa & Brian are the best hosts we've had throughout our 20+ stays on Airbnb; they went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable, and 2) Related to #1, the transportation -- particularly with the free unlimited passes included -- was super easy and made our stay very convenient; the place is located right by the bus stop that takes you to the metro (the \"T\"), or you could simply make the short 10-minute walk. \n",
            "\n",
            "Either way, these two combined made our stay a great one! This place earns our highest recommendation.\n",

Lisa even provided snacks, water, and subway cards to move around and printed directions/maps for us to use. She had breakfast items available for guests, great tea and coffee! It was easy to get from the airport using public transportation. Definitely will be coming back to Lisa's place in a future visit to Boston. Great first Airbnb experience.\n",
            "- Lisa did a great job to make our stay comfortable. The location is convenient for public transportation. This is our first airbnb experience which turned out to be perfect with Lisa's help. \n",
            "- What a great, welcoming home. I had done airbnb before, but I wasn't sure about bringing my kids along. But it was a big success. Lisa saw to every possible need (from warm, fresh baked cookies to movies on the big screen and homemade popcorn, to pleasant conversation over breakfast ) she made my kids and I totally comfortable. She even set up a cot for my son to stay on. And the unlimited T passes made our trip soo easy. Thanks so much for a fabulous stay! \n",

            "- We felt welcome in Lisa's home from the moment we arrived. We flew into Boston in the morning and she allowed us to check in early. She met us at the door and showed us around. There were many great amenities (Charlie card, light breakfast, coffee, snacks, water, toiletries, etc.). The best thing was the the great advice Lisa gave us on transportation, places to visit, and restaurants. The bus stop right outside the front door was great too, especially with the included Charlie Card! We enjoyed our time in Boston and our first Airbnb stay. We would definitely visit again and stay with Lisa again. \n",
            "- The friendly hosts promptly answered our pre-trip questions and gave us helpful tips for using Boston public transportation. They provided two “Charlie Card” transportation passes for us to use while visiting. We enjoyed their suggestions for things to do and places to eat around the area. The bed was quite comfortable and the private room had a locking door for privacy. Thoughtful touches included welcome snacks, clean towels, air conditioner and a noise-canceling device for people not used to city living. The den and living room had reliable WiFi, a pet  Australian bearded dragon and eclectic decorations. The bathrooms were clean, well stocked with shampoo/conditioner/soap and featured a nice “rain flow” showerhead. Use of the kitchen is a plus while traveling. Cooking pans, utensils and provided eggs, cheese, milk, bread, cereal, coffee, etc. made breakfast special. \n",
            "Lisa and Brian made us feel at home – we will definitely stay with them again next time we visit Boston!\n",
            "- The stay at Lisa's and Brian's house was great ! We booked four nights in a very cozy bed. We enjoyed getting breakfast in the morning and the passes for subway and bus were convenient! Also Lisa was very helpful about giving information about everything. For example my twin and I turned 21 during our time with them and Lisa told us where to get the first legal drink in the US. It was so much fun ! \n",
            "We love Boston and if we ever come back, we'd like to stay with Lisa and Brian again. \n",
            "Thank you for an amazing time ! We highly recommend this place !\n",
            "- Lisa and Brian made us feel very welcome in their home, which is what I'll remember most about this Airbnb. The layout of their place is spread across two floors within a multi-family building, and on each floor, there is one or two Airbnb rooms. They offer great amenities (light complimentary breakfast/coffee, unlimited T pass, basket of snacks/water in the room, fresh banana bread!) so it feels more like a homey guesthouse/hostel than other Airbnb's I've stayed in.\n",
            "- Lisa is a wonderful host! Everything is well thought-out, from the breakfast area to the transit passes (super helpful). She provides great suggestions of places to visit, too. The location is convenient - the Orange Line is a 10-minute walk from the apartment, and it takes you straight to the heart of Boston. The neighborhood has a handy co-op market for groceries and snacks. All in all, a fantastic spot for a fun, memorable stay. \n",
            "- Lisa was a lovely, sweet guest, quiet and considerate. The house is very  convenient and clean.We enjoyed getting breakfast in the morning and also received subway passed for our stay which was excellent. Lisa 非常的友善和有亲和力,她的房子所处的位子也很方便,而且干净。我们也很感谢Lisa能提供早餐和地铁卡,一次很愉快的体验!\n",
            "- Lisa is a warm and very accomodating person. Her house is very charming, organized, and comfortable, and my boyfriend and I had a lovely one night stay there as well as some fun chats with Lisa.  It's situated perfectly, just 10 minutes by foot from the T and sexonds fron many busses.  We will most definitely be coming back on our next visit to Boston!! Thank you for everything Lisa and good luck with your projects!\n",
            "- Lisa is very helpful and made our stay comfortable. The apartment located in Forrest Hill where is the end station of the Orange line. Would recommend to friends who want to visit Boston.\n",
            "- Rented this room for two nights for my 2 daughters (17 and 20). I will leave the details to them in their reviews, but want to note here that everything was above-board and professional. They had no problems getting into their as-advertised room, the breakfasts were generous, the host and hostess were accommodating, and the metro passes were an invaluable perk! Getting to/from the apt from the Forest Hills stop was a little more difficult than anticipated , but this was at least partially due to construction detours. Overall, I would highly recommend this room!\n",
            "- Me and my dad had a good time here, Lisa was very nice and the house was so good!\n",
            "- Lisa was a great host & my room was awesome. The bed was very comfy & the room & place was very clean. If returning to boston I would be sure to get this room & I recommend this place to anyone visiting! \n",

            "- Lisa and Brian were amazing hosts! They were so flexible and kind to us. Lisa was willing to push our check out time back to a time that was more convenient for us. The Rustic Room was great for an overnight trip and the house was very close to public transportation and a few restaurants.\n",
            "- Staying at Lisa and Brian's was a fantastic experience. It was great having been provided with unlimited ride Charlie Cards during our stay and breakfast fixings. The location was convenient with several buses running on the block and a short 5 minute walk to the orange T line. The kitchen was well equipped although we did not have much opportunity to use it during this stay. Lisa went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. She even allowed my daughter to stay in our room during the first of our six nights and set up a cot for her so that she would have a place to stay before moving into the dormitory at her university. When asked bus directions to certain stores, Lisa graciously offered to give us a ride as she felt the stores we wanted to buy some dormitory items for were difficult to get to by public transportation. The house had air conditioning in each room, was clean, quiet, and inviting. I would definitely recommend Lisa and Brian's home and look forward to staying there again on my next trip to Boston.\n",
            "- Lisa was a terrific and accommodating host! She sent directions from the airport ahead of time which were easy to follow, as well as info about things to see and do in the area. The room was neat and just as described, and I especially appreciated the free transit passes and free breakfast. The location has easy access to the T which made it easy to see sights in the Boston area. I would highly recommend this location for those looking to spend time in the Boston area. \n",
            "- My mom and I traveled together to Boston for a quick weekend trip. The city is great! So many fun things to see and delicious food to eat. Lisa was a great host! We had nightmarish megabus delays and didn't arrive until close to midnight. Lisa was nothing but kind and understanding. You won't be disappointed if you stay here! \n",
            "- Lisa was out at the time I checked in (which was a bit later than 2) so Brian welcomed me to my room. He was great, very informative and friendly. Room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. Will definetly try and stay here again whenever I come back to visit Boston.\n",

            "- We had a great stay at Lisa's. She has thoughtfully planned so many details of her home to make it as welcoming as possible. We enjoyed pretending to be locals for a night, and walking from the house to dinner. The free train passes into the city are a huge bonus with this house. Breakfast was excellent. Lisa was very accommodating to us and we would stay with her again! \n",
            "- Best experience I've had with Airbnb. Very welcoming with superb communication. Very clean room/bathroom and wifi works well. They go the extra mile, doing things like recommending things to do, baking you cookies, preparing breakfast and providing anything you might need.\n",

            "- Lisa's place was great.  The bed was really comfy. It was convenient to get to by train or bus from the train station,  being on the orange  line. That seemed to be the line we used most on our trip.  The bathroom was always clean,  and there was only one time we needed to use it,  but it was occupied.  \n",
            "\n",
            "If you are sensitive to noise,  you may ask to stay on the top floor. It's a creaky old house,  so you hear people walking upstairs. It didn't bother me,  but guests came in at two this am and woke up my boyfriend walking on the creaky floors. \n",

Kitchen was well stocked and organized. Enjoyed chocolate chip cookie, muffin and coffee in the morning. Only small drawback is the location which is someway old neighborhood and at the end of subway. \n",
            "- We absolutely recommend staying with Lisa!  The complementary breakfasts were fantastic and the public transportation passes she provided worked for buses and subways!  We felt completely at home, very safe, and well taken care of.  If you will be spending the night in Boston, this is a fantastic option!\n",

            "Thank you for all Lisa ! All was perfect ! \n",
            "- I was in town for a couple of work meetings, so didn't spend much time at the apartment except to sleep. This listing is well set up for the traveler, all needs are anticipated and Lisa provides a generous breakfast offering. Bathrooms are shared, though I never had any wait to access one. And the location to the T and an excellent, local grocery are convenient. Check in and out were easily arranged. \n",
            "- Had to go up to Concord on a Saturday. So happen Lisa was headed up to Concord. Hitched a ride. Fantastic! Just part of the warm hospitality. \n",
            "- What a great stay! We definitely enjoyed our time at Lisa's place. It was cosy and nice, but the best thing was how much time Lisa took to show us around and provide recommendations. The free transit, the great breakfast, the nice and lovely room and the lovely atmosphere are just a few things that can be named as highlights. I could even do some laundry. We really had a great time and would love to come back. Thanks so much for a wonderful time, Lisa and Brian!\n",
            "- I enjoyed staying here last spring so much that when planning a trip to Boston this fall, I knew exactly where to stay. Lisa and Brian are kind, welcoming, and respectful.

            "- Abbiamo soggiornato da Lisa per quattro giorni in due persone nella camera matrimoniale \"Rustic Room\" a piano terra. La casa è una classica villetta americana a tre piani, di cui due sono quasi completamente utilizzabili dagli ospiti. Il quartiere è carino, tranquillo, e abbastanza verde; fondamentalmente è un quartiere residenziale anche se c'è qualche bar e ristorante e un enorme supermercato di cibi biologici nelle vicinanze. Vicinissimo alla casa c'è un enorme parco/bosco veramente incantevole. \n",
            "\n",
            "Lisa è stata un eccellente padrone di casa: all'accoglienza ci ha mostrato tutti gli spazi utilizzabili, la cucina con la zona colazione, il soggiorno comune e presentato agli altri ospiti che soggiornavano insieme a noi in altre camere. Abbiamo trascorso del tempo anche con loro e conosciuto gente un po' da ogni parte del mondo e anche questo è sicuramente un aspetto positivo. Ci ha dato indicazioni, consigli, ed è stata d'aiuto quando ne avevamo bisogno. \n",
            "\n",
            "Nonostante la casa sia posizionata piuttosto lontano dal centro, con 10 minuti scarsi di camminata (o 5 minuti di autobus) si arriva al capolinea della metro arancione (una delle linee che abbiamo usato di più) che in 20-25 minuti ti lascia nel cuore della città. Lisa ci ha anche dato due pass illimitati per corse con tutti i mezzi di Boston, cosa che tutto sommato ci ha fatto risparmiare un bel po'!\n",
            "\n",
            "La stanza è equipaggiata con ogni confort: asciugamani, lenzuola, coperte, snack, merendine, fazzoletti, mappe, televisione, fono, bottigliette d'acqua, grande armadio e perfino una macchinetta che produce uno strano ma piacevole rumore per rilassarsi quando si deve andare a dormire! La nostra stanza aveva il bagno esattamente di fronte.\n",

            "- Me and my husband stayed in Lisa's for 3 nights and that was absolutely fabulous choice. Lisa is a great hostess, who´s made lots of effort for the customers. Lisa had great tips and guides in order to experience Boston widely. Breakfast and free subway pass are something you don't come across very often so big extra plus for them as well. We wish Lisa all the best and hope she'll carry on the same way for the long time to come :)\n",

They had a mini movie room which doubled as a game room with plenty of games to play. The bathroom was nice neat, and if you love a nice hot shower, you'll love the shower. The kitchen was spacious and clean. She had a list of sites, to see places to eat, and other night life to experience.

Breakfast is very good and the free transportation passes are certainly very helpful. The house is a 7 minute walk to the metro station and from there you quickly go to all main spots in Boston. I'd totally recommend her as a host.\n",
            "- Lisa went to great lengths to make us feel at home. \n",
            "- The best AirBnB experience thus far! Lisa's place was very conveniently located right next to the bus stop. Lisa was very responsive in her communication and extremely welcoming. The room was decorated with beautiful and detailed attention! The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen spotlesly clean and convenient to use! We appreciated the great little touches she put into our stay: lindt cholates, nice midnight munchy snack, great breakfast and lovely coffee, free metro passes, etc! We would definitely recommend Lisa's place to anyone!\n",
            "- It was so wonderful experience! Lisa and Brian welcomed me so warmly. Although my English is very limited I enjoyed our chats ). Also in the room you can find a list of historical places to visit, recommendations for cafes and restaurants and other tips on how and where spend time in Boston - a complete city guide which helped me a lot. Thank you for CharlieCard with unlimited Bus and Subway rides - this is so amazing that you offer it to guests. Breakfast is incomparable, in addition, there is a supermarket and you can always cook something for yourself using full equipment kitchen. Thank you very much for such warmth and attentiveness to the guests!\n",
            "- Lisa greeted us at the door and welcomed us in warmly.  We liked her immediately.  She was very helpful with advice and directions.  Her suggestions for places to see enhanced our experience.  She provides breakfast and truly has opened up their house to the guests.  Lisa and Brian are amazing.  We will visit them again when we are back in Boston.  \n",

            "Loved it here and will be coming back! \n",
            "- Really enjoyed the stay with Lisa. I didn't send out the request until the night before and she responded instantly. The place was easy to find. It was clean, and had everything that we needed. Transit was super easy, the CharlieCards that were included helped out big time. It was only about an 8-minute walk to the T station, and in 30 minutes I was right by the legendary Fenway Park. I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a cozy and quiet place not too far from downtown.\n",
            "- Lisa was very timely when responding to us about questions we had before booking.  We found the room to be comfortable and inviting and just what we needed. The room comes with many amenities but the only one we took advantage of was the unlimited CharlieCards which give you access to the subway/buses. There's a bus stop directly across the street and the subway station is only an 8 minute walk down the road making it very easy to get to downtown Boston without a car. We found this room to be of great quality for the value.\n",
            "- Lisa and Brian’s place was in one of the best location. 10 mins driving to Harvard Ave - where has plenty of awesome Asian restaurants. We were staying in both Boston room and Rustic room, for 2 nights. Both rooms are fantastic. We would definitely stay there again if we go back to Boston. The street parking was easy, always found a spot. The bed was comfortable as well.\n",
            "- The room was perfect for the three of us visiting Boston and we just needed a place to sleep while we were exploring throughout the day. Lisa was an amazing host - always answered messages/texts, she was there to greet us and give us a tour of the home, having breakfast and coffee included was great, and she even let us store our bags at her place after our check out time. The best bonus was the travel passes, they are a must if you're using public transportation while in Boston! Very friendly and accommodating hosts! Definitely recommend. \n",
            "- Lisa is such a lovely host.  The location is on a busy street but perfect if you are looking for accessibility.  The room I stayed was on the lower level close across from the bathroom, very comfortable bed with adjustable heater in the room.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I had to leave early in the mornings due to work so I was not able to enjoy the continental provided by Lisa.  \n",

            "This was such a great experience, I would love to stay at her place again.  \n",
            "- From the moment we got there and ate homemade warm chocolate cookies I felt at home!  Lisa is very friendly and helpful and I felt like I was family there.  Her place is accurate to her description.  The bus stops right outside her place and the Charlie Cards she provides for transportation were such a blessing!  She was patient and very helpful with all my questions in person and in text and helped us make good decisions for our stay on places to go, places to eat, and how to get there.  It is a homey atmosphere. It is safe. Bed was comfy.  Shower was wonderful. I didn't use the kitchen but it was available as was the other rooms in the house.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I can't imagine how it could get any better!  The big screen tv was great to watch on one night also.  If I ever go back to Boston this will be my first hope of a place to stay!\n",
            "- It was such a pleasure to meet Lisa. She was very helpful with places to check out and places to eat. The room was just what we needed. The transit cards and breakfast was a major plus. My only regret is not staying longer. Cheers\n",
            "- Good value for a night going to Fenway from out of town. Bed was comfortable, subway passes were very convenient. Was grateful for the light breakfast in the morning. Lisa and Brian were both pleasant and helpful when I met them. \n",
            "- Lisa's Rustic room was great! Description was accurate and even though it was shared bathroom, I loved how our bedroom was right in front of the bathroom; super convenient. Only 10 minutes walk to the nearest subway and FREE UNLIMITED TRANSIT PASS was definitely awesome! Even though we checked out on time, Lisa offered us if we'd like to use Charlie Card (unlimited transit card) for the rest of the day due to next late check-in, we were able to use transit for free ,yet again! Even though we did not get to meet Brian (?!), Interaction was great, place was awesome. Thank you both for providing such a great space and if you come to visit Boston/East Coast again, we will definitely comeback!\n",
            "- Excellent value and comfortable stay. The subway cards made our stay extra convenient. Lisa is very friendly and great with communication. Expect several other guests since they rent out several rooms. \n",
            "- Lisa and Brian are great! They've been extremely helpful and welcoming! Their place is very neat and clean, really provides a homey feeling. The whole experience of my staying was way beyond my expectation! Highly Recommended !!!\n",
            "- We felt welcomed into the home with towels on the bed and a tour of the home as soon as we arrived.  The transit passes that came with the room were incredibly useful, as was the subway map provided to us by Lisa. You could really tell they enjoyed sharing their home. The room was exactly as described. They went above and beyond to provide us with internet when our laptops gave the WiFi trouble. Lisa and Brian made our first Airbnb experience easy, safe, and absolutely wonderful. \n",
            "- Lisa & Brian were fantastic hosts! There were chocolates on towels to greet us, in addition to a basket that had 2 water bottles and several snacks. The continental breakfast had a lot of great choices, and I'm glad the hours had a wide range so we could make ourselves breakfast if we had to get up early, or slept in. The bed was very comfy. This house is right on the street, so if you are not used to street noise you might want to bring earplugs. There was a white noise machine in the room & that helped us sleep just fine.  They also provided a guidebook they had made of area recommendations - we tried Ethiopian food for the 1st time @ Blue Nile & it was wonderful! They also had a guest book where previous folks left their tips & recommendations.  I also loved that they had a bearded dragon named Kaiju that you could pet if you asked (He has a WARDROBE.  Prepare for your instagram to blow up.) Lisa & Brian also had a TON of tips about restaurants & attractions in the area, which was really helpful since it was our 1st time in Boston. Combined with everything previously mentioned and use of the free metro cards, we had an amazing stay in Boston for a fantastic price! I HIGHLY recommend staying here, you can't beat the hospitality and the value! Thank you again Lisa & Brian - if we know anyone who is traveling to Boston in the future, we know where to tell them to stay, and we hope to make a return visit in the future!\n",

            "- Lisa and Brian were the most welcoming and accommodating hosts we could have ever asked for. They are the sweetest couple and I would love to stay there any time I visit Boston in the future.  You'd be crazy not to want to stay here! Within 10 min walk from the T and the free transit cards were such a relieving touch. \n",
            "- I felt very welcomed at Lisa's home. Really nice neighborhood with accurate description. It was a great experience overall!\n",
            "- Lisa is a very thoughtful host, everything a guest needs is within easy reach,like thread,scissors, tourist guidebooks, breakfast is excellent with bread, milk, eggs, juice and fruit at your choice. Besides,the place is close to subway and buses. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.\n",
            "- Lisa went above and beyond and she worked diligently with our shifting arrival times. Even though our train was three and a half hours late, she still greeted us with kindness and waited up. My daughter loved the room and there was so much to do that I felt sad we hadn't booked the room for longer. I would be happy to stay here again and recommend it heartily to anyone considering it. \n",
            "- Lisa and Brian went out of their way to make us feel home and they helped us whenever we had questions. Our room, the kitchen and the bathroom were clean and we loved the free train passes and the breakfast. :) We can totally recommend to stay at Lisa's and Brian's place!\n",

            "- Absolutely fantastic stay, Lisa has every detail considered to a T, from how to get to the place via any potential mode of transit, to extra supplies and nice thoughtful touches on the room. We especially loved the great location next to the Arboretum (an absolute gem for nature walks and gorgeous foliage) and the good transit connections to Boston (30-40 min). Would gladly come stay again!\n",
            "- Enjoyed our stay in Boston. Lisa was very communicative and Brian did a great job of showing us around the place. \n",
            "- We were made welcome from the word go. Lisa and Brian were excellent hosts, with heaps of tips and suggestions. We were given free unlimited bus passes which were awesome. We were allowed to make tea/coffee anytime, and were provided with breakfast, muffins and biscuits, made by Lisa, and she even did a load of laundry for us while we were there. Thanks Lisa for a fab 3 days. Would recommend this BnB \n",
            "- Daniel's apartment was extremely convenient and close to my brother's house, which was perfect! It was spacious and cozy all at the same time. Totally reasonable price and Daniel was super accommodating.\n",

            "- We enjoyed our stay in Gayle and Sam's home. The location is great for Fenway park and for catching the T train downtown. Although Gayle or Sam were usually home, we always felt comfortable in our space. \n",
            "- Gayle and Sam are wonderful hosts who are flexible, available, informative and friendly.   I had a great night's sleep in a clean, comfortable, quiet room.  The couple left out coffee, and light breakfast fixings including Gayle's homemade granola for my breakfast.  The apartment feels very safe and is convenient to Fenway, Boston University, Newbury shopping and the Mass Ave bridge for walking into Cambridge and MIT.  I highly recommend this beautiful apartment for a Boston stay.\n",
            "- Muy buen lugar perfecta ubicación, Gayle es muy amable\n",

            "Overall, I would recommend this apartment and host...I'll probably be back there myself one day :)\n",
            "- This was a great place to stay. Our hosts Chris and Kris were friendly, responsive, and did everything they could to make us feel welcome.

            "- We rented Kristina and Chris's place for a long weekend and it was perfect!  It was our first time in Boston and we loved the neighbourhood, and the apartment.  Kristina provided us with very clear and simple directions to get from the airport to their place on the subway. Very quick and convenient!  Jamaica Plains, which is a short subway ride from downtown,  is great neighbourhood with some very good restaurants and nice places for a drink. The Whole Foods Store was also short walk away which was perfect for filling the fridge. After a couple of days running around town in was nice to be able to just  cook  dinner and kick back in your own cozy apartment.  The kitchen was well equipped with everything you need to cook a good meal.   We'd definitely stay with them again!\n",
            "- The studio apartment was great, and Chris and Kristina were really nice hosts, easy to contact and even able to accommodate our early arrival time.\n",
            "We were in the city to check out a few neighbourhoods, and they were happy to spare the time to sit and chat with us about Boston. Their area of JP is lovely, and within walking distance of Centre Street, for restaurants and shops. We used the T to get everywhere, and were glad to make use of the area's on street parking. \n",
            "\n",
            "Thanks again!\n",
            "- Chris's place is a really great alternative to Boston hotels, which are always $$, or if you just want to stay somewhere homier.  Especially for a longer stay.  Truly is very large studio in excellent condition.  A great value for the price. Pleasant and responsive hosts (though you are not actually sharing a livings pace with them). Places like theirs just make me love Airbnb more than ever!\n",
            "- I live in a neighboring town, but my bathroom renovation was not completed on time and so last minute I needed a place to stay for the weekend. Kristina and Chris were very prompt in responding, and their studio was great! Very clean, and the location was perfect for me as it is close to the subway and to a really fun main street of good restaurants and shops (and public bus access). There is also a beautiful pond nearby if you are willing to walk a little.\n",

I was greatly impressed with how responsive Kristina was to all my emails related to the booking and prior to arrival; this made it really easy to arrange my check in even while the family was out. \n",
            "The studio is located in a lovely neighborhood, very quiet and almost exclusively residential, so that there is not a lot of traffic. Extra bonuses of the place:  the next metro station (Stony Brook) is a short walk (less than 10 min) away, the train gets you to the city center in less than 20 min; if you walk for 10 min into the other direction you'll find yourself in the center of vibrant Jamaica Plain with access to a number of restaurants of all varieties and price range, stores etc; and close by is the Jamaica Pond - I even went for a run in the morning in the park (with dozens of locals who appear to do that all the time).\n",

            "- This is a really nice place to stay, I couldn't recommend it enough if you are planning a short stay in Boston. I stayed for 3 weeks while working at UMass and shared with my partner for most of the time, so it easily accommodates two people. The apartment is two rooms but has everything you'd need for a stay (there are laundrettes close by as well). The apartment is very light and catches a lot of sun and is spacious enough for only being two rooms (plus bathroom). There's ample kitchen equipment if you are looking to cater for yourself for a while. The further plus point is the location! It is literally 5-7 minutes walk to the Orange line on the T and then 15-20 mins. to downtown and T connections. It is walking distance to Jamaica Plain/Centre St. which is itself an interesting area with restaurants and bars and shops (good Whole Foods store for quality groceries and supplies). It's a nice neighbourhood, leafy and walking/jogging distance to parks and Jamaica Pond. Then the further plus is that it's very quiet at night! The hosts Kris and Chris were always on hand in person or on email and sorted out any issues promptly and gave a lot of good local advice and were welcoming hosts! A really good spot to stay if you are planning a visit to Boston.\n",
            "- Kristina and Chris could not have been better hosts. The studio was immaculate and spacious, and is in a great part of town. We loved Jamaica Plain. It's easy to get to the centre of the city but JP retains a unique character and sense of community. The local restaurants and cafes are superb and Kristina and Chris gave us some great tips. They were also very generous in answering all our questions about Boston. JP is the perfect place to stay if you really want to feel part of the city, and Kristina and Chris will give you the sort of warm and friendly welcome that you rarely get in a hotel. \n",
            "- Kristina and Chris were extremely respectful, thoughtful and quick to respond to any request I had.  It's a cute flat and didn't want to leave Jamaica Plain, great place to stay, top marks - thanks guys\n",

Allthough the studio is an extension of their own house, It's very private. It has its own private entrance at the side of the house. It has a comfortable bed, bathroom, big kitchen, and lot's of windows. Chris & Kristina were very communicative and helpful before and during our stay. We didn't get to meet in person, but kept in touch through airbnb en and sms.\n",

We arrived quite late in the evening and Kristina was there to greet us, explain the area and direct us for groceries and food.  The studio is well equipped and JP a lovely area in itself.  The T is only a 5 minute walk away - about 20 minutes to central Boston.  Having the dishwasher was a nice touch. Good TV and sound system (great British loud speakers!).  We enjoyed our stay very much.  \n",
            "- My husband and I stayed over Memorial Day weekend and had such a wonderful time. Everything that I would like to say has already been mentioned in previous reviews, but I will repeat some again. Chris and Kristina were excellent. They were quick with their responses and very thoughtful, for example they emailed me a map of the area highlighting the local points of interest, such as shops, T stop, parks, and cafes ahead of time. They had wonderful suggestions, that always proved to be enjoyable. They are pros and we are recommending their studio to all our friends. \n",
            "Jamaica Plain is such a nice respite from the city. The studio itself is on a residential block which is nice and quiet.  If you want action walk over to Center Street a couple of blocks away where there are many bars, restaurants, and shops. \n",

            "- My boyfriend and I had a wonderful 3-night stay in this studio.  Even though we didn’t have a chance to meet in person, Chris and Kristina were perfect hosts.  We experienced some unseasonably cold weather during our visit, and our hosts took it upon themselves to deliver a space heater to the studio to ensure that we would be comfortable.  They also were extremely easy to communicate with during our stay and were very helpful in answering our questions about getting around the city.  The studio itself was immaculate and in a perfect location, just about a 5-7 minute walk to a subway station that conveniently took us right downtown for shopping and all the attractions.  We would definitely stay here again the next time we’re in Boston!\n",
            "- Kristina and Chris made it a wonderful stay - my wife and I only met Kristina briefly when we first arrived, but it was very clear that they were available if needed for anything. The studio is highly recommendable; just the right amenities, size, and price for our relaxing one-week \"babymoon\". Location is great, and the handy area guides Kristina provided really made for smooth sailing!\n",
            "We could have stayed much longer comfortably, and would certainly recommend the studio to family and friends visiting Boston. The bed was comfortable and the place was very clean. We will definitely check availability of this studio for return visits.\n",
            "- Kristina and Chris were the perfect hosts, friendly and very helpful, giving us lots of information and help with all our questions. The apartment was as shown in the pictures, very clean and comfortable - they even provided airconditioning when it was very hot in Boston. The location is very close to the public transport system (subway), shopping and laundromat, restaurants close by. Ample parking available on the streets. We had a lovely stay and would recommend the apartment without any reservations. \n",
            "- Kristina is a helpful and gracious hostess, and responded quickly to questions and requests (including coming up to help us get the TV setup going while preparing dinner for her family!). \n",

            "\n",
            "The apartment is actually a studio on the back of the host's house with a separate entrance. About 8 minute walk from the subway which takes you into the heart of Boston within 10 minutes. The neighborhood is close to a lake and several nice cafes, my wife and I would get breakfast then take a walk before heading into the city to see the sights. We both felt at home in the studio and enjoyed that it was outside of the city a little bit, felt like the countryside a bit but still gave us convenient access to the city.\n",
            "- The studio was an excellent size for the 2 of us to spend a couple of days in Boston, and had everything in it we needed to have a comfortable stay.  Chris and Kristina were extremely responsive and quick to respond to any  queries we had.\n",
            "- Our stay in Boston was great! Chris & Kristina's appartment is located in a beautiful & quiet neighbourhood and it's only a few stops away from the city center (public transport only a few minutes to walk from the appartment). The studio is beautifully furnished and very well equipped (kitchen, TV, internet, bathroom... all as described!). A perfect appartment for exploring the beautiful city of Boston and its surroundings.\n",
            "Chris & Kristina were great hosts - fast and friendly communication before we arrived, a warm welcome, great tips on where to go... \n",
            "They and their family are wonderful people and we enjoyed meeting them  and talking to them. It was also great to learn about the history of the neighbourhood and get a bit of background information.\n",
            "THANK YOU for having us!\n",
            "- Nice studio with all you need and a 5 min walk to the underground T and a nice organic convenience store! Kristina had it all ready for us.\n",

            "The \"T\" is only a short walk from the apartment and it takes about 15 minutes to get to Downtown Crossing. On the way to or back from the T you can pop into a nice little shop or a liquor store.\n",

            "We highly recommend this studio!!!!!\n",
            "- Our stay at Chris & Kristina's guest house was everything we could have asked for and more!  Their place is located in a great neighborhood lined with large beautiful Victorian style houses.  A quick and easy walk to the metro and a few stops later you are in downtown Boston.  The apt itself was very clean and fully equipped with anything you may need to enjoy your stay be it short term or long term.  Chris and Kristina were very helpful in directing/instructing us whenever we had questions and were nice to leave all kinds of info/maps on Boston to guide us to anything we wanted to do.  I would HIGHLY recommend staying here and i will 100% return on my next visit to Boston if its available! \n",
            "- Very nice studio and Kristina and Chris were very helpful and considerate.  Great place to stay for a trip to Boston.\n",

            "- We had a great 4-night stay in Boston at this apartment. Here's a quick summary of how we felt. \n",
            "\n",
            "Location: Neighbourhood was beautiful, clean, and quiet. As expected, we did have to take the subway into the city but it wasn't a big inconvenience since the transit system was very reliable. Very small grocery store around the corner but it sufficed for snack and breakfast food. My boyfriend and I had a lovely 6k run that was almost entirely in an expansive (and quite picturesque) park nearby (don't know the name unfortunately).\n",
            "\n",
            "Apartment: Quite small, but clean and well-maintained. For a short stay like ours, the kitchen was just what we needed. We kept milk and leftovers in the mini fridge and all the appliances (stove/oven, dishwasher, fridge, etc) were in great condition. That being said, I don't think the kitchen is well-enough equipped to do much serious cooking. \n",
            "\n",
            "Hosts: Chris and Kristina were very gracious and friendly. I forgot my iPhone charger and Kristina was kind enough to loan me hers for the week! \n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, great experience and would certainly return for a short stay in the city.\n",
            "- Lots of information in the kitchen available. Kristina also was helpful in providing more information. Nice quiet place near Boston center.\n",
            "Clean room, kitchen and bathroom. \n",
            "-  We're very impressed with Chris and Kristina's prompt reply to our booking request for the same day. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed for our family of three. And it was a short walk to the train station into central Boston and to local shops and restaurants. Overall verdict, awesome!\n",
            "- Le studio de Chris et Kristina est joli, chaleureux, lumineux et très propre. Nos hôtes ont pris le soin de s'assurer que tout allait pour le mieux à notre arrivée et lors de notre départ. En plus, ils nous ont laissé une tonne d'infos utiles concernant les meilleurs restaurants, les meilleurs endroits à visiter et les services à proximité! Parfait pour un séjour en amoureux dans un quartier agréable. À deux pas du métro en plus! | Chris & Kristina's studio is cute, welcoming and very clean. They made sure everything was perfect for us and gave us tons of useful infos concerning the neighborhood and the best restaurants in town! And we loved the neighborhood so much: friendly people, laid back atmosphere and... two minutes walk from the subway line!\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina's place, in a lovely area of Jamaica Plains, was clean, bright and had everything we needed. It was super great to have a thoughtful map of their favourite and handy places in the area and this, coupled with other maps provided, saved us so much time figuring out where to go! Also so close to the train line! Thanks so much.\n",
            "- After the two-night stay at this studio, my friend (who visited Boston the very first time) and I (who's been there more than often) had the same conclusion: we are definitely coming back!\n",
            "\n",
            "Kristina and Chris are very responsive and helpful to all our questions before, during, and after our visit. And the studio itself is just perfect with a good size of kitchen separated from where the bed is. A big plus: I actually fell asleep on the super comfy sofa-bed couple times!\n",
            "\n",
            "More than important: it's located at a really safe, quiet, and convenient neighborhood with everything you would ask for! Whole Foods Market, several decent restaurants, tram station are all in walking distance. If you happen to be a runner like me, running along Jamaica Pond watching the sunrise was just epic and very enjoyable!\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm certainly going back if visiting Boston again, and highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a place to stay.\n",
            "- This studio is very well appointed with all a single person or couple could want. The subway is a short walk away and it is a bit different to stay in the suburbs rather than the city as its quiet and peaceful. Kristina was very responsive and happy to answer any queries. The bed was extremely comfortable. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a bit of peace while still being close to the city.\n",
            "- Great location,large bright and airy apartment. No traffic noise and lovely neighbourhood. Short walk to subway. Kreistina met us on arrival and gave us a good orientation and provided lots of maps and guides to Boston.\n",
            "- My boyfriend and I loved this place. It reminds us of our places at home, we both live in studios. It was very clean, and we were greeted as soon as we arrived and taken to it. We had like described our own entrance, and we came and went as we pleased. It was a full kitchen, we used, and telly with comcast, which we also used. The bathroom was just fine, and the bed was seriously sooooo comfortable. My boyfriend wants to get one just like it. It was very nice to come back into a residential neighborhood after our exploring, and it was a 10 minute walk to the Stony brook orange line stop. Would stay here again and highly recommend to anyone visiting Boston. Also lots of restaurants nearby that we ended up eating at, lots going on in Jamaica Plain!\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina have a great place. I highly recommend staying here.  The neighborhood is  a lot of fun and the apartment is ideally located within walking distance of the T and bus, \n",
            "- The apartment was perfect, exactly what we were seeking for exploring Boston. The hosts were very helpful and had already prepared a list with all the good spots and restaurants in the neighbourhood you need to go. The place was very well equipped and we immediately felt home. The neighbourhood is very good and it takes only two minutes to the metro station from where you can go directly to downtown Boston. We would definitely stay here again.\n",
            "- Kristina and Chris were excellent hosts, providing local information and careful arrangements for our arrival. The apartment is self contained, attached to their house in a most attractive part of Jamaica Plain, south west of Boston City centre, about 7 minutes walk from the Orange Line subway and easy access to all parts of Boston. Spacious room, large comfortable bed, plenty of seats. Jamaica Plain has good amenities, good restaurants (including Tres Gatos and Ten Tables) and a nice place for breakfast (Aromi), all within easy walking. Victorian clapboard houses and lots of trees. A thoroughly satisfactory stay.\n",
            "- We really enjoyed our stay, the appartment was spotless and very comfortable. Ideally situated for local shops, restaurants & bars, even better only 15 minutes walk from Sam Adams Brewery!! Do visit, it is well worth it.\n",
            "The T station is even closer, make sure that you purchase the \"Charlie\" ticket to get into the centre of Boston & suburbs. We had a great time exploring the city and found plenty to do, even if all the tour guides had to keep mentioning the American revolution & the English troops! \n",
            "If you are flying out from Boston late evening, please do not make our mistake and assume that you can leave your luggage at the airport and enjoy your last day in town, they do not have have a left luggage facility. Chris & Kristina did say that a later check out may be possible, do see if you can, we missed it!\n",
            "Alan & Kate, Cambridgeshire UK \n",
            "- Excellent choice for us.Apartment comfortable with a good size kitchen really well equipped.Subway system  conveniently less than 5minutes away so we were able to reach central Boston within 10 minutes  and were able to make a good start to seeing some of the many attractions of this beautiful city.We are very grateful to Chris and Kristina for letting us stay in their very convenient apartment and being so unobtrusive ,so that we were able to relax for 4 days, as part of a month away from home.Many thanks.\n",
            "- We received a warm welcome from Kristina. The apartment was spacious well equipped  which fromed a perfect base for our first visit to Boston. A great quiet neighbourhood, easy commute to the city. We were very impressed with the train service.\n",
            "- We had a very good first experience with Airbnb, thanks to Kristina! Very good communication (fast message response) back and forth! It was our first time being in Boston, and it was a wonderful experience, partly because we had a nice place to rest, and called our home, away from home! The only negative was the arrival of hurricane Sandy, that delayed our departure with a day! Kristine really worked hard to see if we could stay another night in the studio! Unfortunatly for us, her other guests where planning on coming.Kristine called us back later that they had to cancel, and we where able to use the studio for another night! Unfortunatly we had made some other arrangements already by that time. Thanks for all your help Kristine, we really appreciate it. We will definitly try to stay in your studio again, whenever we come back to Boston!\n",
            "- Extremely nice studio. We could not hope for better, perfect studio (clean, everything that you could need if you want to rest a little in the flat, nice bedroom/kitchen/bathroom just for you) in a so lovely and quiet neighborhood (5 min walking distance to the metro). Perfect if you want to a more friendly place than hotel and if you want to feel at home after daily visits of Boston). I would definitely recommend this place and also because of the interesting price in comparison with city center hotels and some AIRBNB offers! Thank you Chris and Christina.  I missed your neighborhood!\n",
            "- The Wirth's were great hosts and the Studio apartment was very well equipped for our stay in the Boston Area.  It is a very convenient location, within walking distance of the \"T\" and several local shops.  We hope it will be available when we return to Boston as we would stay there again!\n",
            "- Super apartment, super location, super hosts! Kristina was always available for assistance but made us feel the apartment belonged to us. A well equipped kitchen & close by organic market made for relaxing mornings over breakfast, and the nearby T station gave us access to all parts of Boston. A definite stay for anyone coming to Boston!\n",
            "- Great little studio for my inlaws, they loved it. We will use again next time they come to visit! Kristina was very helpful and accommodating.\n",
            "- My parents love this neighborhood that full of Victorian houses, really peaceful and convenient.\n",
            "Kristina is a good host and really considerate, I will stay there again~\n",
            "- Second time staying at the studio. It was as great as the first time. Chris and Kristina are great hosts. The studio is comfortable and has everything you would need. The pubs and restaurants nearby are fantastic. Chris and Kristina left a list of notables in the apartment, we tried a few and they were all well worth the visit. The studio is in a charming neighborhood and a 5 minute walk to the T to bring you anywhere you need to go in Boston within 30 minutes. Truly great place. Definetely recommend!!!\n",
            "- A fantastic place to stay in Boston. My wife and I were visiting for the first time, and the studio was a fantastic homebase for our four-day exploration of the city.  The neighborhood is safe and has a host of great restaurants, bars, (and the Sam Adams brewery) etc. all in walking distance, and the Orange line was a super-convenient five-minute walk away. It was really nice seeing a corner of the city that we wouldn't have if we were just sticking to the traditional tourist spots. The studio itself was clean, very private, and homey, with a nice kitchen and an extraordinarily comfortable bed. Kristina was really accomodating and cheerfully answered our questions.  Would stay here again in a heart beat.\n",
            "- Veyr nice and comfortable studio, tons of light (very nice in winter), ample kitchen which is very helpful if you plan a longer stay. It is 5m. away from the subway and it takes 15m to get to downtown. The neighborhood, Jamaica Plain is full of little restaurants, cafés,  and if you want a bit of exercise you have the Pond. So it is a good mix, a relaxed place but very close to the amenities of downtown. The place itself  is very tidy, clean and well equipped. Kristina and Chris are very good hosts and very considerate. I highly recommend this place! \n",
            "- What an excellent option for staying in JP!  Kristina was accessible, friendly, and kind.  The studio was just the quiet, clean retreat I needed after long tiring days at my company's main office.  Plus, it is just blocks from the T, and a short, enjoyable walk to Centre Street and all its good food.  I slept well on the comfortable bed and enjoyed eating breakfast in the bright kitchen.  I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in town, and hopefully I'd have more time to cook in that big kitchen!\n",
            "- Chris & Kristina's studio is extremely clean with lots of character in the colorful decor.  We experienced a lot of snow in early March, and one of us was sick for most of the trip, but the studio was a great place to cozy up from the cold.  A little shop around the corner (on the way to the T station) was convenient for coffee, snacks, and veggies, which also helped to make the studio home-y.  Thanks for creating such a great space.\n",
            "- This would have been a 5 but for another New England snow storm and broken car which prevented the owners being there for our stay last week. We became the property caretakers and snow shovelers. I was able to stay in contact with the owners by email and phone and let them know of a few things which were missing or unworkable in the kitchen. These were really minor compared to the great place they provided us. We would definitely stay there again. The neighborhood is terrific - funky, beautiful, safe, and easily accessible to anywhere in Boston via both bus and the \"T.\" The 39 bus at the bottom of the street took me directly to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Gardner Museum in no more than 20 minutes. \n",
            "- A great place to stay in Boston!\n",
            "We felt absolutely fine and comfortable at Kristina and Chris' place.\n",
            "The apartment was very clean, quiet, cozy and close to the subway and bus station.\n",
            "We would stay here again and recommend it to anybody.\n",
            "-  Our stay here was really nice! It's a super cute place, tons of privacy, and Chris and Kristina were super duper helpful and communicative! Comfy bed and a coffee pot, what more could a girl ask for?\n",
            " Highly recommended! Great place!\n",
            "- This was a great place to stay. My girlfriend and I stayed here for our vacation to Boston, and really loved everything about this studio. The studio itself is very cute - it is well decorated and has great fixtures! The nearby area is fantastic - lots to do in Jamacia Plain: great restaurants, bars, and shops. It is also a 5 minute walk to the Orange Line, which made seeing the rest of the city a breeze. The host was great as well - she gave us a great welcoming and provided info about the area, and then was only around when we needed her - the studio was very private.\n",
            "\n",
            "Would absolutely stay here again!\n",
            "- Delightful accommodation in Boston. Studio was perfect for us. Very clean and excellent kitchen facilities. Nearby grocery stores so we able to cook a number of evening meals. Perfect location--just a couple of minutes walk to the T-line--so very easy to explore the city on foot/public transport (no car required). Also a beautiful nearby park/pond for morning runs and evening walks. We loved this! Kristina was absolutely lovely to deal with--friendly, responsive and very helpful. We would certainly recommend this accommodation to anyone heading to Boston.\n",
            "- Kristina and Chris were friendly, informative, easy to reach, and helpful throughout our stay.  The apartment is a ten minute walk to the subway and the subway is a fifteen minute ride to downtown Boston.  Exceptionally convenient.  Little neighborhood grocery stores abound within walking distance of this private second story fully equipped apartment.  Comfortable sleeping for two.  Be careful about parking next to the unmarked sidewalk wheelchair cutouts - they are hard to spot, especially at night.  They also attract tow trucks.  Fun stay.  We'd do it again.\n",
            "- We enjoyed the stay with Chris & Kristina very much. They were friendly, helpfull, and considerate in any way possible. The appartment was clean and comfortably fitted, and very conviniently situated. We would very warmly recomend them to any of our friends, and would love to stay there again.\n",
            "- Loved our studio apartment in Jamaica Plain area of Boston. It is very private and in a VERY quiet neighborhood close to the T station with handy access to everywhere you can think of for sightseeing in Boston.  Kristina and Chris do a great job of keeping a lovely place with all the maps and suggestions for restaurants, etc that you would need.  We would rent again in a heartbeat.  \n",
            "- Kristina est très accueillante et répond à nos besoins rapidement.\n",
            "Studio très vieillot,mais propre,fonctionnel et près de tout avec le métro. Quartier très tranquille et joli avec ses vieilles et belles maisons.Vive Quincey market,pas besoin de préparer les repas du soir,on achète du tout cuit,poisson,homard,patés etc.\n",
            "Avons bien aimé notre expérience .\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina have a wonderful, private space to stay in Jamaica Plain. It's close enough to the \"hustle and bustle,\" but far enough away to feel more relaxed. They did a great job of communicating prior to our arrival and during our stay. Loved having a comfortable bed, good shower, full kitchen, and second floor views. Luckily the weather was perfect and there was no need for either air conditioning or heat. Some windows had screens, so that provided enough air flow. All in all, a nice getaway spot.\n",
            "- Great stay in Jamaica Plain:) This apartment is so comfortable and a great base for touring Boston. It really is a 4minute walk to the subway and about 12minutes on the subway to the downtown crossing. Kristina was easy to get a hold of and communicate with when we needed to. There is a full kitchen with all the amenities too if you need it. Bed is very comfortable with lots of extra blankets and pillows available. Jamaica Plain is also a fabulous neighbourhood to investigate. We would 100% recommend this apartment to friends:)\n",
            "- The flat's airy and bright and is in a great area of Boston.  It's got all the amenities you'd want for a short break and it's very private and quiet.  Chris and Kristina had left us some useful information with recommendation of where to eat and drink in Jamaica Plains, plus there were general Boston leaflets and maps to look at too. The local area has a good selection of bars and restaurants and we can recommend the free Samuel Adams Brewery Tour which is just down the road! \n",
            "- Chris and Kristina's place was wonderful! Very clean and very private. They were very accommodating despite our arrival at an ungodly hour.  Their place is in Jamaica Plain which is in a residential side of Boston. The neighborhood is friendly and safe.  The subway station is maybe a 10-15 minute walk and you can take the orange line directly into the heart of Boston.   This was our first time using Airbnb and I was thoroughly impressed. I would highly recommend staying with Chris and Kristina during your trip to Boston.\n",
            "- The studio was perfect for our Boston trip and we loved jp area.  Kristina was helpful and so pleasant to work with. Would definitely stay here again!\n",

            "I was sorry to leave after a week with Chris and Kristina\n",
            "- Chris & Kristina's studio apartment is wonderful--wish we had one at home like it! The location is good with a subway stop just 5 minutes walk away.  There is an excellent range of amenities nearby, which the hosts had documented in a thoughtful information sheet complete with maps.  (We can recommend the coffee at the City Feed & Supply Store just 3 blocks away!)  The check-in was easy and Kristina had kindly anticipated our arrival on a hot evening by turning on the air conditioner in advance.  There were only two small inconveniences: the WiFi signal was a bit weak although Kristina did try to adjust it and the bathroom louvre doors were a bit temperamental.  We will definitely plan to stay here on our next trip to Boston.\n",
            "- We enjoyed our stay. Great location! Jamaica Plain is a beautiful neighborhood with everything you need within walking distance.\n",
            "The apartment is clean, updated, and well-kept. Large, comfortable bed easily sleeps two and the quiet window unit kept the room cool. The kitchen is large and well equipped. \n",

It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the Stonybook Station on the Orange Line. Kristina was superfriendly. I might not always go to Boston, but when I do, I will stay here. \n",
            "- Great hospitality from Kristina. Nice place. We also enjoyed the privacy of the place. Perfect size for the three of us. In the middle of Boston's Jamaica Plain, very safe, quiet and nice neighborhood. Very good for a family. 5 min walk from train station. Excellent communication with Kristina.\n",
            "- Kristina and Chris's studio was the perfect little getaway! It looks exactly as pictured and they live up to reviews as friendly, accessible, and helpful hosts. I adored the cute space and we genuinely enjoyed the neighborhood. It was so simple to navigate the subway/train system from their home (thankfully since we had a but of a rough time driving in Boston haha). I highly recommend their studio, and if I find myself returning to Boston I will definitely re-book there! \n",
            "- I recently stayed with my husband at Chris and Kristina's apartment. It was really nice and quiet, and the apartment was very clean. Kristina was extremely responsive and helpfull. She left us a map with lots of recommendations which we followed and enjoyed. We liked the neighbourhood because it was like living the real Boston, not touristic at all!! The metro station is only 5 minutes walk away. I certainly recommend staying at Chris and Kristina's!! There's also a good choice of restaurants and deli's nearby. We would like to thank both Chris and Kristina for their kindness and hospitality.\n",
            "- A truly wonderful studio on a quiet street in Jamaica Plain, with convenient access to Orange Line trains and minutes from an unparalleled selection of restaurants, cafes and parks. Kristina and Chris were outstanding hosts and really seem to have thought of everything. Highly recommended!\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina's studio in Jamaica Plain was the perfect place for our family to stay while exploring Boston. The space itself is true to the photos, with the kitchen being more spacious than expected. Completely clean and comfortable, with cute stylish furnishing. The neighborhood is very charming and public transportation is mere blocks away, as well as a nice neighborhood park/playground, Whole Foods, cafes, Sam Adams Brewery,etc. We were car-free with an older child and an infant during our stay, and were able to get around on foot quite easily (FYI, we live in a rural area, so are by no means accustomed to having to walk to the store,etc). Kristina and family were on vacation during our stay, but she was always extremely responsive and helpful via text. We truly did not want our stay there to end! \n",
            "- Great studio in Boston, very accommodating hosts - we couldn't have found a better place to explore the city. \n",
            "- Chris and Kristina's studio was just perfect!  We stayed for a week and the studio was completely comfortable for an extended stay.  Full, well stocked kitchen (actually larger than appears in photos), VERY comfortable bed, cosy living area with a fancy tv/sound system and light and airy throughout.  If you're familiar with the area, it's ideal...and if you're not, it's still ideal because it's safe, quiet, close to the subway, w/in walking distance to all JP has to offer including the pond.  And not too far of a drive to Walden Pond!  We would love to stay here again.  Thanks Chris and Kristina!\n",
            "- We had a lovely time staying at Kristina and Chris’s studio flat. It was clean and light. All the windows could be opened which was great as we had perfect weather. The kitchen/dining area was, as other reviewers mentioned, bigger than it looks in photos and well equipped. The neighbourhood was very quiet, especially at night, which was amazing when you consider it was only a 5 minute walk from the T and then another 10-15 minutes on it to be right in the centre of Boston. Check-in and communication was very easy and pleasant with Kristina and she was very accommodating when we couldn’t be completely accurate with our arrival time and with our late request to add an extra day to the start of our stay.\n",
            "- I had a wonderful relaxing stay at Chris & Kristina's charming and colorful studio apartment.  Quiet and comfortable in a lovely neighborhood, yet less than 15 minutes to the T station.  These hosts are very reliable and responsible.  Would definitely recommend.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Susan\n",
            "- It is a great studio, perfectly located in a wonderful part of Boston. The subway can be reached perfectly, but to park a car was easy too. \n",
            "\n",
            "Kristina & Chris had prepared some perfect recommendations for restaurants, super markets and other facilities in the near area. But there were also tips for the stay in Boston.\n",
            "\n",
            "The studio is very quiet, clean and pleasantly furnished. Due to its separation from the rest of the house, you do not get in the way with the hosts.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's an absolutely wonderful place in Boston (which is by the way one of most beautiful spots on the east coast), which I will recommend to all of my friends.\n",
            "- Kristina was a marvelous host.  She was able to answer all our questions prior to our arrival, and was able to cope with a last minute timing change caused by altered airline schedules. We found the studio very clean and comfortable, and really enjoyed it's location outside the city proper, so we were able to experience a broader range of Boston's architecture and services. The studio has easy proximity to the excellent T-line system.\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina are nice folks with a lovely place in a beautiful neighborhood. The arrangements and communication were easy and efficient. I would recommend the location to anyone who wanted to experience an eclectic side of Boston with a convenient subway stop just two blocks away. \n",
            "- We had a lovely stay in Chris and Kristina's flat which was comfortable, had everything we needed and was in an interesting area of Boston. Although a little out of town it was very close to the trains and to shops and restaurants. Communication was easy at each step with Kristina. For a couple this worked really well. thanks! Michele and Jim\n",
            "- I had a delightful stay at Chris & Kristina's.\n",
            "\n",
            "I came in late in the evening and Kristina was very receptive and welcoming. I had no problem to communicate with her whatsoever, very quick on the texting trigger - haha!\n",
            "Very great place, pictures are the reality, very cozy, trendy, lovely and calm area everything you need is there in a walk. I shall book it every time I'll head to Boston, oh oui!\n",
            "\n",
            "Merci beaucoup pour tout!\n",
            "- Great location and studio! Super close to the train, which was a ten minute ride into downtown. JP was an awesome neighbourhood as well, amazing Chinese food and pub about a ten minute walk away. Kristina was zippy with all correspondences and super welcoming. Lots of fun, I look forward to going back!\n",
            "- This was the perfect studio for my mom and I! It was so clean and bright, and Kristina was very easy to communicate with before and during our stay. I loved that it was a 5 minute walk from the orange line, and the walk back at night was well lit and I felt very safe! I love the houses in Jamaica Plain, it was fun to just walk around and see the neighborhood. I would  definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others! \n",
            "- I had such a wonderful time in Kristina and Chris's studio. It was so comfortable, cozy, and perfectly located in the charming Jamaica Plains neighborhood. Kristina was so communicative and easy to get in touch with regarding the apartment. I loved the neighborhood guide they put together with restaurant and cafe recommendations. Huge plus that there is easy access to public transportation to the rest of Boston. I would stay here again in a heartbeat if I'm in the Boston area and highly recommend it! \n",
            "- My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Kristina & Chris' studio.  The studio is exactly as advertised - cozy, clean & in a WONDERFUL neighborhood.  We had never visited Jamaica Plain before, and absolutely loved it!  Nice shops, huge variety of restaurants, and lots of dogs out with their owners, which helps when you are missing your furry family members.  Jamaica Plain is also sooo convenient to the rest of the city - 5 minute walk to the T, and a 10 minute ride, and you are in the center of everything.  When we return to Boston, we will definitely book another stay at this lovely studio.\n",
            "- Staying in Kristina and Chris's sweet studio in JP was a delightful experience!  They welcomed us warmly and invited us to feel at home.  They managed a perfect balance of accessibility and privacy.  The studio was completely equipped with everything we needed for our three night stay.   The neighborhood offers many fine cafes and shops within walking distance, including our favorite fair-trade, organic coffee house and market, City Feed and Supply.   Kristina, Chris and their two boys are life-loving, enthusiastic folks.  It was an absolute pleasure to meet them.   We look forward to staying with the Wirth family again some day!\n",
            "- It's a lovely studio with lovely ammenities and a super accomodating host (is that the right word?)\n",
            "The only downside was that we were there while it was super cold and the place was a bit chilly. There was a space heater, but a better heating system would have made a bit of a difference. The location is unbeatable for it's green environs and quick walk to the T and the kitchen is great for self-catering. \n",
            "The bathroom is right next to the bed with a folding door, which makes toileting very intimate, so stay with people you know really well. \n",
            "- We stayed at Chris & Kristina's lovely apartment for a whole month while we were moving and couldn't have asked for better hosts. \n",
            "\n",
            "Everything from the check-in process, the cleanliness, the supplied equipment and the great area ended up in a great stay for us. \n",
            "\n",
            "The apartment is located on a quiet side street in the neighborhood of Jamaica Plain, walking distance to several restaurants, bars, public transport to downtown and parks. \n",
            "- Chris & Kristina were incredible Hosts. The studio was adorable. They even put up blinds for me to make it more private. The location  was perfect. JP is an awesome neighborhood. The studio is walking distance from restaurants, shops & bars. And, the T is a few blocks away. Win, win! I highly recommend staying at the Super Studio. \n",
            "- We loved our stay here. The apartment was exactly advertised and very comfortable. Their neighborhood in Jamaica Plain was full of charm. They are very convenient to the T, making a trip downtown very quick. We ate some great good in the area at Chris and Kristina's recommendation, including fantastic burritos at the Purple Cactus and wonderful sandwiches at City Feed and Supply. Check in and check out couldn't have been easier. They were very responsive when we had a question. We always found a parking spot right in front. \n",
            "- a wonderful place and an equally wonderful host. Comfortable, quiet and quaint. Just a nice place to come back home to after a long few days of conferences. . A big thanks for coffee in the cabinet!! Highly recommend and will definetly stay again. \n",
            "- Excelente ,todo bien ,a pesar de la distancia es muy facil llegar a Jamaica Plain .El estudio es muy lindo ,limpio y con buenas comodidades .El lugar muy tranquilo\n",
            "- Chris and  Kristina's studio was perfect for our stay. It was very warm even if it was cold outside. They even allowed us to check in early. It was very near the T and the neighborhood is beautiful.\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina's place is great! Very clean, everything was as promised, and Kristina was always there when we needed her with helpful tips for transit, restaurants and things to see (or avoid). We loved the area - Jamaica Plain is beautiful - it was very walkable and close to the orange line \"T\" station. We even walked to the Samuel Adams Brewery tour. I would definitely recommend this to a single person or couple looking for a nice place in Boston. We hope to stay there again if we're ever in the area!\n",
            "- Kristina's place was just perfect for our needs and we had a great stay. We had excellent pre-arrival communication with Kristina, a warm greeting upon arrival, and fantastic insider information about the area (including a map of Jamaica Plain that identified some of the shops and restaurants which was very helpful). The suite was perfect for us (3 adults) with a full and well-equipped kitchen that was separate from the sitting/sleeping area. The house is located on a quiet street in the heart of Jamaica Plain and is just a 5 minute walk to the bus stop (bus #39 that links into the Green Line subway and provides good access to Fenway/Backbay) or the Orange Line subway station (and was a quick 15 minute ride to the centre of downtown).  I would highly recommend this suite and definitely plan to return on our next trip to Boston.\n",
            "- We didn't meet Chris, but Kristina was very welcoming and accommodating. She even carried my wife's bag up the stairs. There was also no problem with us checking out a little late. The studio had the charm you would expect in an 1860\"s house, but was appointed comfortably as well. The neighborhood was very nice,quiet and had adequate parking with no permit required as is common in most Boston neighborhoods. We were only a few blocks from the T station with a great neighborhood spot to grab a coffee on the way.\n",
            "- This was a great place to stay! It was on the top floor of a house with its own private entrance, and it was very quiet and well equipped.  The location was absolutely fantastic - walking distance to shops and the Stony Brook T station.  I was traveling by myself, and I felt entirely comfortable walking around the neighborhood after dark.  I also rented a car during my stay and was able to find street parking within about a block of the house.  I would absolutely stay here again!\n",
            "- We enjoyed our stay in this roomy studio.   I loved the comfortable bed!   The neighborhood was great--we felt completely safe walking back at night.   The Wirths were great hosts and thought through our needs well as evidenced by how they equipped the studio.\n",
            "- We were very pleased with our stay at Kristina's. This was our first AirBnB experience and we are pleased to report it was as expected, if not better. The room is large and spotlessly clean. Comfortable bed and cable tv - can't complain at all! The apartment is in a great neighbourhood, very quiet and close to some great restaurants (Tres Gatos is a brilliant little tapas bar within 5minute walk; Canary Square and equally good SportsBar/ restaurant just across from Tres Gatos). I would highly recommend staying here as we love the fact it is within 10-15mins of downtown, but without the noise/chaos of staying in the heart of the city). Kristina is a great host and made us feel at home. No complaints, great value for a long weekend in the city!\n",
            "- We spent 4 days in Kristinas studio and had a great time. Everything we needed was there (fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, even a huge TV!) and the studio was very clean and comfortable. We only met Kristina once at the check-in, she was nice and gave us all the information we needed. \n",
            "\n",
            "The neighborhood seemed to be very safe and the next metro stop into the city just 10 minutes away. \n",
            "We had a very good time and can recommend this studio!\n",
            "- Wij werden bij aankomst 's-avonds gehaast door de verhuurder ontvangen. Het appartement voldoet in grote lijnen aan de eisen voor een verblijf van meerdere dagen. Het appartement is gelegen achter de woning van de eigenaar en de ingang bevindt zich in een andere straat. Het staat in een leuke wijk. Rustige buurt en voldoende privacy. Metro, supermarkt en restaurants op loopafstand. Minpunt is dat er door airbnb was gemeld dat het appartement over airco beschikt, wat echter niet het geval was. \n",
            "- Kristina could not have been any nicer, this was a delightful trip all round . \n",
            "- We didn't actually get to meet Chris & Kristina, but they made sure we were comfortable and taken care of during our stay (they even installed an air conditioner mid-weekend, while we were out, since it was so hot outside - very thoughtful).  The studio is quite small but clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, though just a short walk from the many shops & restaurants on Centre Street.\n",
            "- JP and this Studio were really as expected and advertised. The neighborhood is so nice and quiet. Only 5 minutes’ walk to the Subway is an extra plus. My son and I were here for the Red Sox, so, only two stations away and a walk took us to Fenway in about half an hour. The hosts were very accommodating and rapidly quick to respond to any questions we had. A really nice family! We will be back in Boston and would definitely stay here again.\n",
            "- My mom and I had a fabulous time here. Kristina was an excellent host. She accommodated our request for early check-in and was reachable by text throughout our stay. The kitchen is very well equipped, the bed is comfy and the shower had good water pressure. This is a great space with lots of windows. We had a rental car one day and it was super easy to find street parking at night.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I would highly recommend this studio if you're in town for at least a few days. However, if you're in Boston for 2 days and want to maximize your time there, I'd think again. While the studio is only a short walk (5 minutes) away from Stony Brook station, the subway (the orange line) was not running frequently at some time of the day, so it took us some time to get to the back bay area. In short, super lovely place, but not the most convenient. It worked well for us, since it was not our first visit to Boston and we had 3 full days there. It depends on what you're looking for.  \n",
            "- Host Kristina was very helpful in advices before and during our stay.  Fast responses, a good host. The apartment has all the things that we needed. Since it’s a little out of town, if you’re a first timer in Boston and have no car, I would recommend to see MBTA web site and have a look at the subway system.  Orange, green, red line…  truly not difficult and after that you will be able to visit most attractions in Boston.\n",
            "So we really enjoy our stay at this apartment.    Enjoy your stay in Kristina’s apartment, enjoy Boston!\n",
            "\n",
            "- This was my first AirBnb experience. The apartment is exactly as promised. The hosts provided excellent, quick communication. The neighborhood was lovely. Using the train was very quick and easy and it was nice to explore a different neighborhood. Very clean. Everything you need is there. Only suggestion is if wifi is important then maybe not book this place as we had an issue getting on with a weak signal (wasn't important to us anyways). Highly recommend the place. \n",
            "- Séjour très agréable au studio de Kristina et Chris! Toutes les indications nous avaient été donné pour facilement trouver le studio. Ils nous ont spécifié à plusieurs reprises qu'ils étaient disponible si nous avions des questions. \n",

            "Enhorabuena!\n",
            "- We had a fantastic weekend in JP!  The studio was clean, cozy, quiet, and Kristina made us feel very welcome.  I would definitely stay there again.  We also really enjoyed the neighborhood - fantastic restaurants, cafe's, and a quick walk to the subway.  \n",
            "- We had a wonderful stay in Kristina's studio in JP! Kristina was super responsive and helpful from the day we inquired about booking and was able to accommodate our request to arrive a little early. We live in NYC, so when we come to Boston for vacation we like to stay in JP because it is so relaxing and beautiful while being an easy T ride into the city. Kristina's studio was just that -- the perfect place to relax after spending the day out and about. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here on our next trip to Boston! Thanks! \n",
            "- We had a great stay at Kristina and Chris's apartment! The studio was clean and very comfortable, perfect for our trip to Boston. Kristina was very welcoming and accommodating to us. I would definitely recommend this apartment\n",
            "- Stayed here with my boyfriend for his birthday and we absolutely loved Chris and Kristina's unit. The amenities and description were 100% accurate and in person, the apartment is even cuter than shown in the pictures. We felt so lucky to find this gem in JP! Can't wait to stay there again. \n",
            "- This was our first experience with airbnb. Very nice studio, just as described. Very quiet area with supermakets around and very good public transport to the centre of Boston.  Kristina was very helpful. we would go tthere again.\n",
            "- We had a great stay here! The apartment is nice and spacious and the neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. We felt totally safe walking around here at night. The location had easy parking and close access to public trans to go downtown. We would definitely stay here again! \n",
            "- Together with my husband we were staying in this studio for 6 weeks. My husband was doing a course at Harvard Business school (Cambridge) and I was doing a research project at Harvard School of Public Health (close to Roxburry and Mission Hill). Basically, you have everything you need in this studio: a well equiped kitchen, a cozy table to sit on, a couch, flatscreen TV, a neat badroom, and even a cozy balcony to enjoy your coffee and the squirrels who visit you once and while. \n",
            "The neighbourhood is really great  and convenient with parks, shops and the metro station nearby.  Chris and Kristina were really friendly owners and were happy to give you a hand or advise you about where to go or what to visit in Boston.\n",
            "We enjoyed or stay very much and the studio is definitely suitable for both short and long stay Boston visitors.\n",
            "- L'accueil fut agréable et très aidant. La propreté de l'appartement laissait un peu à désirer. Sous le lit l'aspirateur n'a pas dû être passé depuis plusieurs semaines et les barreaux du lit n'ont pas vu de chiffons depuis plusieurs jours.\n",
            "En conclusion, c'est cher pour ce que c'est.\n",
            "- We felt very welcome.  The listing was exactly as described and we loved the neighborhood.\n",
            "- The accomdations were great.  The studio apartment was well appointed with everything we needed.  It was conveniently located to all that Jamaica Plain has to offer.   Christina was very friendly and helpful and answered any questions we had.\n",
            "- Kristina was a friendly and helpful host.  The studio was cozy, clean and as advertised.  The location was great.  The studio is a 5 - 10 minute walk from Whole Foods, CVS, restaurants and the subway.  We would stay again.\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina were absolutely wonderful hosts for our brief stay in JP.  Their studio was exactly as described and very close to the Orange Line which was convenient for all the sightseeing we did in Boston.  Even though Chris and Kristina were out of town, they were very kind to check in and make sure we were ok.  We would definitely stay again!\n",
            "- The apartment is great. Its a central location in Jamaica Plain.  Its on the 2nd floor. The kitchen is perfect for making meals while away, and comes equipped with everything (fridge is small). The bed creaks when you get out of it.\n",
            "- We very much enjoyed our visit at Chris and Christina's JP Studio.\n",
            "Accommodations were very comfortable, clean, bright and cheery.\n",

Our host was gracious, welcoming, extremely responsive to any of our needs, while at the same time giving us plenty of privacy and personal space.  The neighborhood is excellent and we had a very enjoyable stay.  \n",
            "- This is my first airb&b trip,even with heavy snow ,I still think it is nice ,the location is convenient to the Metro,the host is friendly,and the hostess is hardworking ,thanks Kristina !\n",
            "- The apartment was actually better than described.  It's more of a two room apartment than a studio.  It was scrupulously clean and inviting.  The bed was comfortable for me and my wife.  Everything one wanted was there where you would expect it to be.\n",
            "Kristina was welcoming and generous. The location in Jamaica Plain was great for us.  There are no hotels even close, and it let us walk to our daughter's apartment in JP.  Also close to Center Street, a street full of nice stores and very good restaurants. Finally, the price was VERY fair for what we got.   In all we would certainly want to go back.\n",
            "- This private studio conveniently located in Boston is everything it promises to be.  The apartment is in an lovely community of historic buildings, a coffee shop/grocery is directly between the subway station and the house, and the apartment was equipped with everything we wanted to make home meals and to hang out.  Chris and Kristina make you feel welcome and attended to without intrusion, so it feels just like you have a little place of your own in the city.  We will definitely call again next time I travel to explore this fascinating city.  Megan\n",

            "\n",
            "The studio itself was lovely, everything was clean, fresh, and well maintained. My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights and three days and the space was cozy but we never felt cooped-up. The bed is very comfortable and the extra hangers in the closet were a helpful and thoughtful touch. The space heater next to it worked beautifully and warmed up the entire space.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's located within half a mile of several great cafés, restaurants, and little shops, which was lovely. We didn't have the chance to use much of the kitchen but from what we saw it looked nice! The little two-person table was perfect for quick meals together, and the dishwasher spared us handwashing, which was a nice thing not to worry about during a weekend away.\n",
            "\n",
            "One small note: while there is a mini fridge there's no freezer, which was fine for us but might be good to know for future guests.\n",

            "- Appreciated the prompt and friendly communication from Chris and Kristina, and the space was better than expected, more like a two-room flat than a studio.  Easy walking distance to everything in JP - the T, restaurants & shops on Centre St, park areas, Sam Adams. Excellent place to stay in a great neighborhood.  \n",
            "- This is a delightful studio in a quiet part of the JP neighborhood. Everything in the studio is as advertised making for a wonderful stay, but the only thing to know is that there is a very flimsy bathroom door, which is 3 feet from the bed. The location is ideal, with close walks to transportation and food.\n",
            "- The apartment was clean, private and in a great location in Jamaica Plain. There was a lot of street parking available and on a quiet street. The location was convenient, close to restaurants and business. We enjoyed our stay here and recommend it to others.\n",
            "- This was our first AirBnB experience and it was simply great. Chris and Kristina are very nice and friendly hosts who were really responsive both prior and while our stay. The apartment itself was clean, spacious and offered everything you need for a pleasant stay. Jamaica Plain (JP) is a very nice and quiet area and the nearby subway station (Stony Brook) is only eight stops away from Downtown Crossing  (10-15 minutes). You could also enjoy your iced coffee from the local shop on the way to the station :). \n",
            "- We had a great experience! Chris and Kristina were very accommodating to all of our needs, they even let us check in early! The studio was everything it said in the description and we would definitely  stay there again. Parking was easy and the neighborhood was great!  This was our first Air B and B experience and we were presently surprised and can only hope every experience is like this one! \n",
            "- This is my first experience to airbnb and i found it is a wonderful experience. Kristina made our family feel like home and the apartment is clean and tidy ! We also enjoyed the quite location and good neighborhood. We will come again next time if we stay in Boston.\n",
            "- We really enjoyed our stay!  The location is great. Kristina was there when we needed her but we felt very private at the same time.  Close to neighborhood restaurants and the T-line.  We bought a week pass for $19 and went into downtown, the beach and the airport.  Thanks you for a relaxing stay!\n",
            "- While we didn't get to spend much time talking to our hosts (our fault - we were so busy) they were very welcoming, accommodating and pleasant. I really enjoyed the location - Jamaica Hills was beautiful and a little off the beaten path, but we were very close to both the metro station (short ~10 min ride to downtown) and some Hubway bike stations, as well as parks and restaurants. The residence was great too - private entrance, two-person bed and a couch you can fold out into a bed. It worked well for our group (me, my brother and my father).\n",
            "\n",
            "Great time and very nice hosts!\n",
            "- Loved staying at Chris and Kristina's flat. Comfortable and quiet. Well placed for for the subway. Jamaica Plain is a perfect plafe to stay. Everything as described, would stay here again. Thanks for hosting us.\n",
            "- Jamaica Plain where the apartment is  situated is a great area and well-placed to explore Boston. Chris and Kristina's written guide to all the places of interest was excellent and meant that we were able to make the most of our few days there.\n",
            "- Kristina was an excellent hostess. She was always quick to answer questions, made sure we were comfortable and provided a vast array of local maps and information about things to do in the area. The house was clean and well maintained. We were close enough to walk to local shops and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.\n",
            "- We enjoyed staying at Kristina and Chris' apartment.  It was raining when we arrived and Kristina handed us umbrellas, and gave us a nice welcome.   The flat was exactly as described, and a nice, quiet and comfortable space.  Very convenient access by public transport, and we also enjoyed walking to restaurants and shops in Jamaica Plain -- JP Licks was a great stop for ice cream and breakfast.   We would definitely stay here again!\n",
            "- We were in Boston to play tourist for 3 days and just needed a home base. The studio was perfect: clean, comfortable, kid-friendly.  Kristina and her boys were delightful hosts who made us feel right at home. Can't wait to book our next trip!\n",
            "- Great experience. Room is just as described. Photos are accurate. Great area. Food and grocery within walking distance. Downtown Boston short cab ride away. Hosts were available but not invasive. Very helpful to answer questions and provide local insight. Would stay again.\n",
            "- We visited our daughter in the area and so did not meet our hosts but the apartment suited our needs well. It would be a little tight for 3 adults. The neighborhood is very interesting with lots of shops on Centre street. O recommend hopping on a Hubway bike there and taking a spin up the Emerald Necklace to the Charles river or taking the Southwest corridor. \n",
            "- We had a lovely stay at this little apartment, it's really cosy but also feels light and airy too - pretty much exactly as in the pictures! Our hosts weren't there to meet us personally but left keys and instructions for us to let ourselves in - communication was great and any questions we had were answered straight away.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lovely chilled out area to wander around. We liked that we were provided with a map marked out with places of interest and good restaurants and cafes - we tested a few out!\n",
            "\n",
            "The only thing I will mention is the bathroom door is a sliding one and there is quite a gap round the edge so depending on how close you are with the person  you are sharing with you may want them to go to the kitchen whilst you use the bathroom! Haha. This may or may not bother some people...\n",
            "\n",
            "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it to others :)\n",
            "- We had a wonderful experience with the studio and our time in Boston.  While we were never able to meet Kristina, she still managed to make sure we had everything we needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "The studio is exactly as described and VERY short walk to the Orange line, a grocery store and Samuel Adams.\n",

            "The next time we're in Boston,  we will stay here again.\n",
            "- We were first time Airbnb users and were thrilled with the experience.  I had questions about the Transit system in Boston and Kristina emailed us back right away.  She also kept in contact up until our arrival. Chris and Kristina left the key and their number to reach them if needed.  We met up with them later in the day.  They are very warm and hospitable hosts.  Informing us of a local music festival that was going on in the neighborhood that weekend.  The apartment was perfect.  It has a private entrance and is decorated so nicely.  So many amenities!!!  It really is a home away from home.  They thought of everything.  We will definitely come back!  The people of Jamaica Plain are friendly and creative.  We enjoyed the support of Community throughout the neighborhood.  The stores and restaurants display local artists works.  JP is a beautiful area with classic Victorian homes.  Each one unique.  The area is safe.  We took the train back to the apartment from the city at midnight and felt completely secure walking through the neighborhood. JP is only about a 20 minute ride into downtown Boston from the Stony Brook T station.  So convenient...you can park for free on the streets of JP.  No parking permit necessary.  Hop on the T with a Charlie card ( for only 19.00 for the week)its good on the T and busses.  You can basically get to anywhere in the city and that includes transfers to any of the T lines.  Honestly...the best Boston trip ever!  THANKS\n",
            "- Great location 5 mins walk to T train station and then short train journey into Boston (10 mins)\n",
            "Jamaica Plains is a safe and quiet neighbourhood with some good restaurants.\n",

            "- We were very pleased with our first Airbnb experience! The loft was exactly as pictured and Chris and Kristina were fantastic hosts, very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Our only complaint was that the wifi was slow and wouldn't always connect.\n",
            "- This was our first experience on airbnb. The loft was great, private entrance, 4 minute walk to the train station and 15 minute ride to Fenway Park. We felt safe walking in the area and there were several great restruants near by. Kristina was great and the space was just what we needed. We would certainly come back. \n",
            "- Wonderful stay at Chris and Kristina's place.   They were wonderful and fully communicated everything with us before and during the stay.  We arrived very late and they had our instructions and even allowed us to park in their parking spot so we didn't have to find street parking in the wee hours (THANK YOU AGAIN!)   The studio was clean and perfect base for our Boston adventures, it was walking distance to Sam Adams and the T stop was super convenient and easy to get to.   The only thing different from the pictures that was noticeable was the bathroom door was a little less private than pictured - luckily we have been married for awhile and are long past that being an issue.   Overall we glad to make this our home base and we would gladly recommend (and stay here again!)   \n",
            "-  We had a very nice stay. The studio was just the right size for my daughter and me. It has a great location to the subway, downtown, and Jamaica Pond. \n",
            "- Our experience was great!! After a long day of traveling, Kristina met us at the curb with a smile and a little treat!!! She was very accommodating and checked in with us to see how things were going for us. Our lodging was perfect for the two of us! Just enough space!! A really wonderful experience in a marvelous city with an awesome hostess!\n",
            "- Hemos pasado unos maravillosos días en Boston. El apartamento era muy amplio y muy confortable. Estaba limpio tenía todo lo que podíamos necesitar. Incluso detalles como un mapa del barrio con localización de tiendas, restaurantes, etc. Sin duda volveríamos allí si volviésemos a Boston\n",
            "- Clean. Spacious for one or two. Convenient to a great Boston neighborhood where I was visiting family. I'd stay again. \n",
            "- Wonderful experience! The privacy and location were exceptional. The apartment was immaculate, comfortable and exactly what I was looking for. \n",
            "- Great stay! Chris and Kristina were extremely responsive before the stay, and they made sure we had everything we needed when we arrived. They were very responsive if we needed anything during the stay, but otherwise didn't bother us at all! The place was great and we would definitely stay again!\n",
            "- We--my husband and our 4 year old-- visited Jamaica Plain, and wanted to stay in the same place as last year, as it is perfect --good location in JP, great kitchen, cozy and clean. Thanks alot Kristina and Chris (we have not met them yet!).\n",
            "- Chris & Kristina were very welcoming and were ready to help with whatever I needed. The space is simple but complete and was perfect for my needs. The location is great - very close to the T and an easy commute downtown. I will definitely stay again if the need arises and would recommend the apartment to anyone visiting JP.\n",
            "- This apartment was exactly as advertised.  We came in late at night, were told where to find the key and where to park.  The apartment has everything you would need for a stay in Boston, very clean, full kitchen, very cozy place.  We would love definitely come back. \n",
            " \n",
            "- Kristina was a lovely host, greeting us when we arrived and even recommending restaurants to us. She was also efficient and helpful whenever we came across any problems. The studio was exactly as described, and was very comfortable for the month that we stayed there. \n",
            "- My daughter & I stayed here for two nights while visiting colleges & touring Boston for the first time.  The location was great, as we were able to park our car & then use the T to easily get in & out of town.  It was extremely convenient to Northeastern University (two T stops).  The place was  just what we needed and fairly comfortable.  The double bed was comfortable, but the pull-out sofa was basically just cushions on the floor, so not as comfortable for my daughter.  Otherwise it was well equipped with everything we needed and we enjoyed the big-screen TV & the DVDs provided!  We didn't get a chance to explore the neighborhood too much, but it was an easy walk to the T station and we enjoyed seeing all the beautiful homes in Jamaica Plain.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to leave the car behind & explore Boston by T and by foot!  We will stay here again if my daughter ends up going to college in Boston!!\n",
            "- Overall we had a great stay at this studio. We didn't spend very much time there and didn't utilize the kitchen, but location was very convenient for our needs, and the space was clean and organized. The check in and check out was extremely easy, and Kristina was flexible. Side note- I wouldn't recommend using the pull out sofa as an extra bed if you're coming with multiple guests, it did not seem very clean or inviting. Glad my sister and I didn't mind sharing the bed (which was both clean and comfortable)! \n",
            "- My stay at Kristina's studio apartment was lovely and as described. We never met our hosts but they were super accomodating (including letting us check in early) and promptly responsive to questions we had. I used to live in the neighborhood and it was a great spot for a homebase for this visit, for both walking and public transit. Thanks for the great stay! \n",
            "- Nice little place.  Very conveniently located with a short walk to the T, and only a few more blocks to the Sam Adams brewery (free tours - and free beer!).  Kristina was there to greet us.  She couldn't have been more gracious, allowing us an early check-in and ready to answer all our questions, then checked on us during our stay to make sure we were comfortable, bringing us whatever was needed, even a new pull-out bed!  My only con is that the bathroom is far from private, with just a folding closet door between you and the bed, and a very small shower.  But it's very clean with lots of amenities - microwave, small fridge, full kitchen with plates, cutlery, pots, etc, even coffee and tea in the cupboard (loved that!), iron and ironing board, hangers, and blow drier.  Thank you, Chris and Kristina, for allowing us to share your studio.\n",
            "- My husband and I were very satisfied with our one week stay at Chris & Kristina's studio in Jamaica Plain. The studio was perfectly comfortable for us; it was just like the pictures indicate. Very well illuminated, a lot of windows. The kitchen very big and I loved cooking there. Chris and Kristina were extremely helpful. They answered instantly our questions through email, and solved some small inconveniences immediately. Kristina, with whom we had most of our contacts, is very efficient and it is glad to have someone like her as a host. The neighbourhood is great, very nice to take long walks, to the pond, to the arboretum; even to go walking to the supermarket and to the T station was a pleasure. Connection with downtown was perfect through the T or through the bus 39.\n",
            "- I would defiantly recommend staying here if visiting Boston. Beautiful neighborhood with friendly neighbors and a great host. Comfortable and homey better then most hotels I stayed in 5stars for me  \n",
            "- Everything was perfect for our stay. The studio was just as described and provided a  quiet and private place for us away from the intense activity of a new baby's arrival and non-stop movement of our two year old grandson. We were able to refresh and regroup each night for another day. We would happily stay there again. Kristina & Kris were super hosts. \n",
            "- This was a great place. I used to live in the neighborhood years ago and this place was ideally located within walking distance to the great restaurants and shops on Centre St.  in JP and the Stony Brook T stop.  The apartment was set up wonderfully with everything my 8 year old son and I needed to be comfortable.  Also loved the autonomy and convenience of check-in and check-out. Thank you!\n",
            "- Kristina and Chris were great. My parents and brother came in from out of town for a graduation and my house was too small, so they stayed here. It was perfect, with a big kitchen and cozy bedroom. They were very flexible and understanding of first-time Airbnb-ers. Would recommend to anyone coming to Boston and wanting to stay more off beaten path, or near family/friends in JP. \n",
            "- Great location. Lovely neighbourhood. A chill place even for three adults.\n",
            "- Kristina was very accommodating and she let us leave our bags in the apartment before check in time so we can wander around the city.  The neighborhood is quiet and it made us feel like we were Boston residents rather than tourists. Its an upstairs unit and I'm glad we packed light because it would have been difficult to carry a heavy luggage up to the apartment.  The place is clean and has cable TV which enabled us to watch the Warriors game. We were there during the hottest day of the year and needed AC but had issues that was later resolved which we are grateful for.  The place is comfortable and spacious and we liked the sofa bed. We would stay here again and would recommend Kristina to future guests.\n",
            "- We loved staying at the apartment. Kristina is a fantastic host! She was very helpful and nice. She gave us a lot of useful information. The apartment itself very comfortable and beautiful. The kitchen is big enough and there is everything you need to cook. Tv, Internet all functioned well. \n",
            "Subway is near the apartment. \n",
            "- Chris and Kristina were great!   This was our first AirBnB experience and I am so happy it was with them as it couldn't have gotten us off to a better start.  Their studio was perfect for our needs and we loved their neighborhood which is full of unique and beautiful homes.  \n",
            "- This studio is great...clean, comfortable, convenient, quiet, and in a safe neighborhood. It was my first airbnb experience and proved to be an excellent choice. I hope it will be available when I make future trips to Boston.\n",
            "- Chris and Kristina were wonderful hosts. The neighborhood and the apartment were just as they described.  The neighborhood has so much character and the small walk to the subway station made it super easy to get in and out of downtown Boston.  We highly recommend it and would certainly come back!  \n",
            "- This is a great place to stay. Quiet and really lovely neighborhood, about 5 minutes walk to the Metro that brings you in 15 minutes to Downtown Boston. The studio itself was very clean and equipped with everything necessary. Chris and Kristina are perfect hosts, the communication before and during our stay was easy and uncomplicated. Wenn really enjoyed. \n",

            "The key was In her mail box with a nice welcome note and a map to the room around the house above the garage .\n",
            "- This was a great place for us.  Chris and Kristina made us feel welcomed and also had books and dvds specifically for our child.  Excellent location, including proximity to bus and subway.  It is centrally located in the nice part of JP.  It was easy to get to all the restaurants and stores. \n",
            "- Chris and Kristina were great hosts! They were very easy to communicate with, and provided plenty of information  to help us navigate the area. Their recommendations for nearby restaurants were great! They checked in occasionally while we were in town to see if we had questions, but gave us our own space and privacy at the same time.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The apartment is exactly as described. The kitchen has the basic amenities you'd expect and want. The apartment was very close to the T stop, making it easy to get around Boston.

            "- Although I did not get to meet Chris and Kristina they were perfect hosts! They left the key for me with directions to the entrance of their loft; which is absolutely amazing for a nice little getaway. I am familiar with the area but they did have directions for certain locations around Boston which was awesome. I would definitely stay at their place again if need be!! \n",
            "- Happy with the experience, the studio is a stand alone in a quiet neighborhood with public transportation close by. Kristina was great and allowed us to check in a little early since we arrived a little early. Didn't use the amenities much outside of the WiFi, A/C, and bathroom, all worked just fine. Only negative was the Yankee house key that drew the ire of the security staff at Fenway:-)\n",

            "- I was staying at the apartment with my girlfriend for 2 nights while we were visiting Boston. At our arrival everything was clean and the apartment was just as described. The cons are that the shower is really small and it's nearly impossible to shower without getting your hair wet, which is really annoying especially for women. Also the furniture is a little worn. Nevertheless we felt comfortable and enjoyed our stay in Boston. I would recommend the apartment to everyone searching for a cozy stay in a really nice neighbourhood!  \n",
            "- We had a fantastic two days staying in Boston. The apartment was perfect and had everything we needed and then some! Excellent location with a short walk to the T line providing quick transport into the city and Fenway Park. Thank you so much- we hope to return again one day!\n",

The bed is just the right firmness. I loved the JP neighborhood and the lake. \n",

            "- She was very helpful. She helped me a lot when I don't know where to go and how to get there. She is so kind and likable person. She even gave me life advise.

            "- Eliza is such an amiable and sincere person. She was always there to help and she always tried to make sure I had everything I needed. She even gave me a backstage tour in the Boston Opera House, which was an unforgettable experience. Bond, her dog, is such a precious soul. The room and the bathroom was nice and clean, and the house itself has lots of characters. Bus stops are just 2 minutes walk away, which connects to MBTA stations and afterwards it is very easy to get to anywhere in Boston. I highly recommend Eliza's place!\n",

The area is easy to navigate, about a 15-minute uber ride downtown. \n",

The one thing that I've still blame myself is the fact that I have broken the hanger for towels in the bathroom. In spite of the fact Eliza has understood me and got into my situation. Thank you very much for warm welcome and understanding!\n",

Getting to know Eliza and staying at her 1840's farmhouse was definitely one of the highlights of our trip and we will definitely be back to visit. The house is beautiful and not far from the city at all. I highly recommend staying here!! \n",
            "- We simply loved our stay at Eliza's. Right from picking us up at the train station to the moment we bid good bye, Eliza was extremely welcoming and gave us an amazing company :) Her house is fabulous! Really unique with a world of its own and Eliza happily shared with us the interesting history of the house. Her dog, Bond is sweet and very friendly too! Also, the location is not too far from downtown, easily connected by public transport, though for the 3 of us Uber was convenient and affordable too. Highly recommend staying here :) \n",
            "- My boyfriend and I stayed at Eliza's place for a weekend. The house is beautiful and very unique. It's nicely secluded, has a lovely garden outside and the cutest dog inside. The bedroom is a good size and the bed is comfy. Also, the shower pressure was amazing. Location is also convenient - it's a quick bus ride downtown. Eliza is very helpful and generous. We were glad we got to sit and talk to her for a minute among the busy weekend. \n",
            "- We had a marvellous time in Boston - Eliza was a very accommodating host providing us with clean facilities, travel info and personal experience. Her knowledge of local history was very helpful in making decisions on what to look at.  Public transport from her house was easily accessed. We thank Eliza for making our stay memorable.\n",
            "- Although my flight was delayed 5.5 hours which made me arrive to Eliza's at nearly 3AM, Eliza was very accommodating and super helpful when I was sleep-deprived and having trouble finding her place. While I was out most of the time exploring Boston, Eliza was always responsive to my texts and questions and did her best to make my friend and I feel at home. It was also super easy to get to downtown Boston from her home with a short Uber ride.\n",
            "- Eliza is a very helpful, warm and generous host.  She made me feel welcome, answered my many questions about public transport and places to eat in detail, and even lent me a Charlie card to use.  I had space to myself when I wanted it and company with her when I wanted it.  All in all a wonderful host.\n",
            "She lives in a very multicultural working class neighborhood of South Boston in an old rather interesting uniquely constructed house with multiple levels and winding corridors.  My room was simple and comfortable  with a large desk area and a double bed.  There is a considerable library on the main floor which I was welcome to borrow from so I had a good book to read at night.  I had access to her refrigerator and was welcome to prepare my meals in her kitchen.  She allowed me to use small quantities of items like cooking oil, spices, milk for cereal, etc.\n",
            "I can recommend a stay with Eliza for anyone who is happy to stay in a modest friendly home.\n",
            "- \n",
            "This is a lovely home. Very comfortable and extremely interesting with all the antique bric-a brac and incredible garden.  It's a lovely island amidst a pretty rough neighborhood. It only takes a handful of homeowners like Eliza to get the ball rolling to reclaim an area.  I didn't meet Eliza as she was away visiting her mother, but her house/dog sitter Devin was very helpful,\n",
            ".  All in all a delightful experience\n",
            "- Un séjour très agréable dans la belle et grande maison d'Eliza, hôte accueillant et de bon conseil avec qui on a plaisir à discuter.\n",
            "- House and rooms were as described. Host is very attentive but not intrusive. I would definitely stay here again. \n",
            "- What a lovely woman! She helped us in every aspect like directions and public transportation system. Nice,private and comfortable place. We felt like home. \n",
            "- Es war toll, bei Elita zu sein. Sie ist eine sehr fürsorgliche und freunfliche Gastgeberin.\n",
            "- Eliza's house is in the South of Boston but downtown is easy to get to by bus 17 and redline. Bus station is 1/4 mile from the house. Eliza is a very kind host and always trying to help.\n",
            "- Eliza was amazing great communication, easy to navigate area. Lovely dog. Let us use fridge and kitchen with ease. Answered our millions of questions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Area was easy to get around and Boston was amazing. We loved the freedom trail and the common.\n",

            "- Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt und unsere Zeit in Boston auch dank Eliza genossen. \n",
            "- Eliza war wirklich sehr freundlich und stand einem mit Rat und Tat zur Seite.\n",
            "Das Zimmer war genau so wie angegeben, klein aber sehr gemütlich. Die Nachbarschaft war nicht gerade die Beste, aber Anbindung an die Öffentlichen war sehr gut, sodass man nichts zu befürchten hatte. Das Haus ist sehr alt und leider hatte ich in meinem Zimmer eine Maus, Eliza hat aber 2 Zimmer zur Verfügung, wodurch ich Gottseidank in einem mausfreien Zimmer nächtigen konnt- dies war aber leider kleiner, dunkler und ohne Klimaanlage. Für Bostoner Preisverhältnisse aber definitiv sehr fair und günstig! Ich würde wieder kommen.\n",
            "- Wir wurden schon erwartet und herzlich begrüßt. \n",
            "Die Wohnung ist sehr groß und geräumig und wir durften alles mitbenutzen. Gute Tipps für einen Tripp in die Stadt!\n",

            "- The house and the room are big and super clean. Eliza is a very nice person, generous and kind. The bus stop is right in front of the house, about 30 seconds by walk. You can quickly reach the downtown. I raccomand this place\n",
            "- Eliza (and Bond) were the best host(s) I could have asked for! So incredibly welcoming and lovely, and the house is amazing ^^ Boston is such a beautiful city, I'll definitely be back soon! 3\n",
            "- 호스트는 제가 도착하였을 때는 없었지만 키를 잘 전달해주었습니다. 숙소는 설명과 일치하였고 호텔보다 깨끗했습니다! 제가 도착하기 전에 호스트가 설명을 잘 해주어서 별 문제없이 지낼 수있었습니다. 같이 집에서 지냈던 학생들도 친절하였고 제가 한달 동안 미국에서 잘 적응할 수 있게 해주었습니다.\n",
            "- I booked Tom's place for a friend visiting Boston. The studio is in a great location, literally 3 minutes walk to the subway ( green line). Tom was away from Boston, so we communicated through phone and he was very responsive to my call/ text messages. My friend enjoyed his stay at Tom's place- Thanks Tom!\n",
            "- Tom's apartment worked out great for us. We just wanted to spend one night in Boston and the apartment is in a perfect location for what we were looking for. We loved it!\n",
            "- Great Location. Great apartment. Perfect for us for the weekend. \n",
            "Definitely felt like I was living back in Boston being able to walk to everything. \n",
            "- Tom was very prompt and easy to get in touch with. His place in Boston Back Bay was beautiful and in an awesome location. Awesome experience! Thanks Tom!\n",
            "- Overall great price for a great location, comparable to Park Slope in NY in terms of neighborhood, easy access to subways. \n",

            "- The studio is in a great location, we communicated with Tom through phone and he was very responsive to my text messages.  Cleaness of the appartment could be better.\n",
            "- I had a wonderful experience staying at this apartment. It is in a fabulous location, is quiet, very spacious for a studio, and very comfortable. Tom was a fabulous host. He communicated clearly and promptly to my questions. You can tell he is a great guy by the books on his many bookshelves. Or at very least, he and I have the same taste in literature. Half of his books were titles I have read, the other half on my \"want to read\" list.\n",
            "\n",
            " I would be very happy to stay at this great apartment any time I visit Boston. I highly recommend this listing. \n",
            "- Excellent location. Everything was easy when we arrived to gain access and depart. Apartment was clean and a great place to stay. It is a primary residence and therefore had all the amenities one would expect. \n",
            "- The reservation was great. Nice location and Tom was very quick in responding to questions.  Would stay again.\n",
            "\n",
            "- The apartment was in a great location, very attractive area and conveniently close to a subway stop.  The host was friendly and accommodating, he responded quickly to any questions and messages. Unfortunately the apartment was not very clean, although we stayed in the middle of the holiday season, which is a very busy time, so perhaps this is why.\n",
            "- Tom was in contact as soon as I arrived in Boston, so see if I needed anything.  Access to the apartment was easy and convenient.  The location of the apartment is perfect for many things to do in Boston (and convenient to a T stop, for access to many more).  It's a small studio apartment, but I only needed a place to sleep, so it was perfect.  (P.S.--The water pressure in the shower is fantastic.)\n",
            "- Tom's apartment was great and very welcoming. The location was perfect too. Tom was very friendly & got back to us quickly. We highly recommend staying here!\n",
            "- The location and architecture of the apartment are fantastic. Set at the back of the building away from street noise in an exclusive neighbourhood. The subway and Fenway Park is a 5 minute walk in one direction and the great shopping in Newbury Street is 5 minutes the other way.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tom was a very responsive host and answered all queries speedily.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our stay in Boston was great but the apartment standards were disappointing. The host lives here when there are no guests and the level of cleanliness and basic things like hanging space and useful local information were severely lacking. I hope that some of our visit money is invested in a professional cleaner. The bed and sofa were also EXTREMELY uncomfortable, the mattress had no support and creaked so loudly you couldn't even turn over.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have left detailed feedback for the host so that hopefully the next visitor can experience the apartment with the potential it has to be fabulous.\n",
            "- Tom left key just where he said. Can't beat the location.  Parking is tough but we actually lucked out and found meter parking right on street in front of apartment. Don't count on that though. Two of us in apartment.  The apartment itself is fine but really really needs a deep cleaning. It is a bachelor pad and kinda has that aroma to it.   That's really my only negative. It needs a scrubbing.Otherwise great location, pretty building and otherwise fine.\n",
            "- Tom was a wonderful host and I really enjoyed my stay at his apartment. His place is clean and cozy and prime location for everything, my favorite being a short walk to shops and Boston Common. Tom was very prompt when answering any and all of my questions, he left the key exactly where he said it would be, and he gave me a bunch of suggestions when I told him what I like to do. He also left a little note for airB&B-ers with his favorite coffee shops and restaurants which was very thoughtful. I would highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Boston! :)\n",
            "- Tom left a very nice note with recommendations for local businesses, and a copy of Boston magazine with more information. He left out clean towels and told us to help ourselves to tea, etc.  The neighborhood is terrific, our favorite in Boston. \n",
            "- This is in a good neighborhood, nice and quiet. Minutes walk from greenline transit and Hynes Center. \n",
            "The space itself is clean and comfortable, great for one or two. The owner was very helpful, after a rough day of travel he responded quickly to point me in the right direction when I needed it.\n",
            "- Nice studio flat in a great area. Tom was quick to answer any question and made a list of his local favorites to make us feel at home in Boston!\n",
            "- good location, reasonable price, and tom is very responsive. the apt itself is probably best suited for single guys for a couple of nights.\n",
            "- Tom was very welcoming and responsive to my requests, and the studio is basic but cozy, has character, and is quite well located. I enjoyed my stay here; made me feel like a local.\n",
            "- Stayed in this lovely apartment for two nights. Beautiful area, the apartment was clean and really nice. Tom was very quick at responding and equally helpful.  \n",
            "- I stayed at Tom's place for two nights and had a great time! The studio is very well located, near the metro, cafes and restaurants. Even though we didn't meet in person, he was very responsive and left us instructions and recommendations of his favorite places. I definitely recommend!\n",
            "- This was a lovely apartment. It was exactly what I expected it to be. Tom was a fantastic host. He was extremely responsive to any questions I had during my stay. I couldn't ask for a more positive experience. \n",
            "- The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- The place is a perfect location next to subway and shopping and restaurant !\n",
            "Tom is very nice, and helpful! \n",
            "- I could not have a picked a better location than Tom's apartment for my stay in Boston. It was my first time visiting the city and the apartment is in walking distance to almost everything you would want to see in Boston. Restaurants, shops, and landmarks are only minutes away by foot. The apartment was in a great neighborhood and very spacious for 2 people and it can easily accommodate a third/fourth person.  I would stay here again and I would definitely choose this over the hotels.\n",
            "- Tom is a fantastic host at this great location. He's very responsive and the place is terrific for a Boston visit!\n",
            "- The apartment was central to the Boston, just around the corner from the green line which makes the location ideal. The apartment itself is in an older building. The tall ceilings make it ideal in the summer because it keeps it cooler without AC, but because the apartment is older it was difficult for me to open the windows and set up the screens since they stuck or didn't close all the way. The space itself is enough for one person for a longer stay, although the kitchen is very small and could be better stocked with utensils and such. Most of Tom's belongings are being stored here, so there is not much space to put your own belongings. The bed was soft but shook a bit when getting on and off. \n",
            "Overall, a good place to stay if you are only here a short time, or for a longer stay is ideal if you plan on going out into the city often. Tom is very friendly and easy to communicate with.\n",
            "- This apartment has great location such next to subway and Newbury street. It's also very close to MIT and you find convenience store behind the corner. There are also many restaurants nearby.\n",
            "\n",
            "This place has great value.  The studio do what is supposed to do. It's not too fancy but it's quiet and clean. You can watch tv and Internet works well. I would stay here also in the future. And Tom communicated very well before and during my stay. \n",
            "- Tom's place was an excellent location in the Back Bay Area. Place was clean and nice to stay in our own little studio. \n",
            "- It was our first time in Boston and we chosen Tom's apartment because of is great location, in Back Bay which is a fantastic neighborhood, close to the subway and to restaurants and stores. \n",
            "Tom's was very responsive and helpful during our stay. \n",
            "Unfortunately our stay has been ruined by the terrific conditions of the apartment which was not clean at all and not very functional. The kitchen and the refrigerator were particularly obscene (and we just couldn't use them), the towels in the bathroom were dirty and still wet, there was a huge quantity of sand hidden under the carpet, the trash was full, we found hairs on the linens and there was no space four our belongings (Tom lives there and the apartment is full of his own belongings). \n",
            "For our trips we are used to stay in airbnb apartments (our own is on airbnb during the summer period) and never find one in these conditions. \n",
            "We immediately informed Tom who apologized several times and paid back the cleaning cost (it seemed that the cleaning service didn't clean the apartment before our arrival)\n",
            "It's a real displeasure for me writing such a review because I think that Tom is a great person but his apartment's conditions really ruined our stay. \n",
            "Nevertheless, if clean and with some free space for the guests' belongings, I definitely recommend his apartment.\n",
            "- The House was very big, the room was nice and the arrival was no problem at all, as Marlene left us a letter with the key and a very well organized description and map of the house. Unfortunate the sheets were just ready from the dryer when we arrived, later then planed. So if we would've arrived earlier like planed, we couldn't lay down as the bed wouldn't be ready.\n",
            "The people in the house were very nice and very welcoming!\n",
            "Unfortunate it didn't say in the listing how many people live in the house and when we arrived there were about 8 people in the house, which is a lot. Therefore the kitchen wasn't as clean as shown in the listing and the house little messy unlike in the pictures. It didn't bother us too much, because we understand of the situation, although for the room price we would rather be comfortable cooking in the kitchen.\n",
            "\n",
            "My reason for a poor grading is the invasion of privacy, when they moved a table into our room during our Absence, which we didn't like at all. I could have private things or bras laying around. Another incident was; kind of waking us up as we slept in, because the room owner needed something from her room and asked if she could look for it cuz she couldn't leave the house otherwise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Other then that we very liked the room and the friendly students living there.\n",

            "- This little studio was wonderful! Perfect location, nice and sunny, and very cozy. I would highly recommend staying here. Bernie was also extremely efficient in answering any and all questions I had and got back to me within hours. One word of advice - the \"kitchen\" here is quite small, and without much ventilation, so I would recommend using it only for small meals. But no worries, there are dozens of restaurants right out the front door. Excellent stay!! \n",

            "\n",
            "This was our worst lodging experience EVER.  Airbnb sent an email in advance asking to confirm w/ Bernie as host.  We did and also asked 2 questions about early check-in and/or a place to leave luggage.  In the only email from Bernie, he said the check-in was at 12 noon.  Bernie failed to respond in advance of the stay to the 2 emails (8/8/14, 8/12/14) and 1 voice mail message on 8/15/14.  We also sent an email on 8/15 to the Airbnb Help Center marked “urgent” – since we never heard back from our host – but we never heard from Airbnb.  Therefore, we made multiple efforts, including on the day of check-in to raise concerns.  Had Airbnb responded, we would've relayed lack of cleanliness and that the room was not as described.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the office we were told check-in was at 2pm and not noon.  The person at the desk inferred we were lying until the email from Bernie was found that clearly said noon.  This was insulting.  \n",

            "1.Kitchen: The kitchen was disgusting, unusable and a public health hazard.  It consisted of a few appliances wedged into a sliver of a closet (photo).  There was black mold along the sink edges, and back of stove (photos).  Cockroach/vermin droppings were found in the cabinet above the refrigerator (photo).  Pots/pans in this cabinet were filthy (photo).  Kitchens typically have a coffee maker - none here.  Toaster was wedged onto an upper shelf of a closet, next to a hammer and stained pillows (photo).  Noone would ever consider cooking or eating anything in this room.\n",
            "2.Room itself:  There were long hairs on the bedspread and futon that were visible.  Was this room really cleaned?  Room overall not as described – no usable kitchen; dirty, unsafe, and public health hazard.\n",
            "3.Safety: hanging power strip w/ cords (photo).  This is a fire hazard, period.\n",
            "4.Bathroom (photo):  The picture hanging on the bathroom wall had a wad of dust on the picture frame.  How long was this here getting bigger and bigger?  The room was allegedly cleaned immediately before we entered – if this bundle of dirt was there – what else wasn’t clean?\n",
            "5.Building Security: In the morning, we found that the front door, that requires a key to enter, was propped open with a stack of newspapers.  This defeats the purpose of needing a key it is quite easy for anyone to just walk in.\n",

There's nowhere else in town you could get for that price.  With that being said, the place was tiny as expected, kinda dirty, I certainly wouldn't cook in the kitchen or get near it, and a quick rinse in the shower was all the time I really wanted to spend in the bathroom.  Wifi didn't work well (slow to nada almost all the time).  So you get what you pay for.  Don't expect a 5 star hotel here people :)!  Take the opportunity to make staying here a truly memorable experience ;)!!\n",
            "- The room was a little worn, but the location is fabulous.  If you are looking for a clean space to drop your bags near just about everything in Boston, then this is a good spot and the price is right.   The manager was also very willing to accommodate our extremely early check out.\n",
            "- Bernie was very helpful and reasonably quick to respond to any questions or concerns.  The studio is very bare bones, but acceptable, especially if you're only looking for a place to sleep at night and don't plan on spending time there during the day.  Only \"major\" complaint is the pillows were very used and flat.  I had to borrow some from family in the area after the first night.   The bathroom could use some updating, but was tolerable.  Location was excellent.  I would stay here again in the future.\n",

The kitchen is cramped - don't expect to do anything beyond very basic cooking.   Check-in and check-out were easy.  Staying in the Back Bay neighborhood is a great way to experience Boston.  We would rent this apartment again.    \n",
            "- The listing was exactly as described. Perfect location for a weekend getaway. Host was very easy to work with and had no problem accommodating our late arrival. Its definitely not a luxury hotel but that's not what you are paying for here.    \n",

            "- The studio apartment in back bay was as described.  It was a cozy studio apartment in a great location! Walking distance to all of the best Boston locations.  If you are expecting a full kitchen - this is a hideaway smaller kitchen that I probably wouldn't use.  Not a big deal for us because we eat out on vacation typically to try out the local yummy food!\n",

            "- Instructions for getting to the office to get the keys were straightforward. The neighborhood was great, safe, and so convenient to the wonderful sights of Boston. The bed was comfortable and the shower worked well. Other than that, it was a bit dirty, outdated, and the stove needs to be replaced. There was no place to hang towels in the bathroom, which is not good in a humid climate. There is really no working place in the 'kitchen' and no place to put dishes after washing them. The plug in situation was scary with an extension cord hanging off the fireplace mantle with several things plugged into it. A cord snaked under part of the carpet. The cabinets in the 'kitchen' were worn out and/or never cleaned inside. This did not inspire us to actually use them for food storage.\n",
            "- The apartment was as expected per the airbnb reviews.  But everything worked (wifi, TV, refrigerator, coffee maker).  Plenty of hot water for the shower.  OK budget value based on the condition of the apartment (so-so) but worth it for the great location.\n",
            "- Host was away and we had an email to inform us to pick up key from another address. This meant one of us had to wait with the luggage in the dark and rain as there was no one at the listing nor shelter. We feel that this was unprofessional as we were left on our own to negotiate the room and it's facilities.\n",
            "- Excellent apartmente and service. This is what i call A+. I am 24 and went with my girlfriend on vacations to boston. We wanted a place near everything and well kept. This was it. It has everything: Bed, Wifi, Microwave, Fridge, Coffe Maker, TV, Work Desk, Bathroom, Stove, Sink, Utilery(Fork, Cups, Plates). It was very comfortable and private. It is 5 blocks away from a shopping mall prudential and shopping street newbury st. Also close to subway station. I would definitely stay here again! \n",
            "- This place is great!! The pictures really don't do justice on how large this apartment is, it has crazy amounts of closet space and is SUPER close to the subway (took about 20 min to get to union sq). Bernie was very easy to get a hold of and a really nice guy. My friends and I were all coming in at crazy times of the day and had no problem getting keys at any time!! Highly recommended!!\n",
            "- The studio was pretty much what we expected from the photos and from previous reviewers. There was plenty of space for my wife and I, though definitely a 'no frills' kind of experience. for the price and location, I would do this again for sure. Not the cleanest bathroom, but all in all the space met our needs and we had a great trip to Boston. \n",
            "- Vrai galère pour récupérer les clés, nous avons dû tourner en rond 2 heures avant de les récupérer car la personne ne répondait pas au téléphone et ne nous a pas indiquée l'adresse de rdv dès le début!\n",
            "Le quartier est vraiment sympa, calme et safe, proche de tous les commerces et dans un des meilleurs et plus beaux quartiers de Boston!\n",
            "L'appartement en lui même est convenable malgré les problèmes pour allumer les lumières.\n",
            "\n",
            "- The original apartment that I booked had been damaged by a previous BNBer so he moved us to another apartment he had available, which was even better than the one we had booked and at no extra charge. He was very helpful with any minor problems raised such as getting the Wi-Fi up and running. When we had to check out early on our final day before departing in the late evening, he was very accommodating with looking after the bags for the day.\n",
            "- The studio in Back Bay is in the perfect location for visiting Boston.  The place is exactly as described and professionally operated, run like a hotel with properties scattered around Boston.  The main lobby is located a couple blocks away and has lots of tourist info as well as staff to assist you.  \n",
            "- We had a great stay.  Bernie made our extended stay very easy, and being in walking distance to work in the Back Bay was very convenient during this winter's storms.\n",
            "- Great spot! A little hard to find parking in the area, especially late at night, but that is a Boston problem more than anything.  The location itself was close enough to T's and buses for everything I needed to do. It even has a stove and refrigerator if you don't want to eat at one of the amazing restaurants that are only blocks away.\n",
            "Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Boston, great value.\n",
            "- Bernie was very helpful and even gave us an unexpected upgrade.  The apartment was clean and had a great view of the Back Bay.  \n",
            "\n",
            "As I expected when making this booking, the location was excellent and within walking distance to everything.  \n",
            "\n",
            "I would definitely stay here again!\n",
            "- We stayed in Back Bay for 2 nights. The studio was clean, had kitchen amenities and was in a great location. We walked to Fenway and to Copley Plaza/Newbury street with ease.  We had a great time and would definitely book with Bernie again.\n",
            "- We need to call many times before being able to contact the host get in the Studio causing delaying in our schedule. Building and studio are old and pictures need to be updated because there isn't the air conditioned on the right window and the Studio didn't like much clean. WiFi wasn't working but we spent 2 days and we didn't really need so i warn host when we left. \n",
            "Location is great! fabulous Back Bay area, close to T line and easy to get everywhere in the city.\n",
            "- Very pleased with our stay here. Key pick-up and drop off was seamless at their office down the street and everyone there was very nice.  The building is quiet and in a perfect location, right next to tons of restaurants, coffee, bars and walking distance from Fenway.  The apt is pretty straight forward and is a nice clean space and even has kitchen appliances.  Bring your own toiletries (and consider bringing your own towel). The internet wasn't working and it would have been nice to have had the window unit in place since it got pretty warm during the day.  Very minor compared to how much we enjoyed our trip and our stay here. Thank you!\n",
            "- We enjoyed our stay. The apartment is in a very nice residential area. Great access to the Charles River Esplanade for running or walking. Checking in and out was very easy. The apartment was nice and tidy. As mentioned in other reviews the WiFi did not work and there was no air conditioning but this did not affect our stay.\n",
            "- Key pickup (3 blocks from the actual apt) was very smooth despite some last-minute changes to our plans.  Wifi didn't work, as has been the issue with so many other reviews, so this listing should probably stop advertising that internet is available.  My husband and I are from the area and had no problem navigating our way around town - we only used the apt to sleep, so it was perfect for our needs!  The apartment isn't luxurious by any means, but it was clean and tidy.  The bed was not the most comfortable, but I am 8 mos pregnant so that may have been the primary issue!  Perfect location for exploring the city on foot. \n",
            "- The property was as-listed with the exception of working WiFi. It is what it is... a space to lay your head while you're out and about in Boston. Location was perfect, but if you're looking for upscale amenities, this is not your place. For the rate, however, you will be hard pressed to find better value. The 10am check out was negated by being able to store our luggage at the key drop just down the street. \n",
            "- Conclusion:  Mismatch between expectations and reality. \n",
            "On the positive: The apartment has an excellent location, nice and quiet neighborhood, near the river for a nature walk, plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, many types of stores and services within walking distance.  People at the rental office are nice, straight forward and gentle. The first day  I  requested to re-clean the apartment and change the bed sheets which they did. \n",
            "However, my overall evaluation is: “disappointment“, mostly because it was short from my expectations. Since the strict policy for payments make no room for regrets (neither reimbursements), I had to stay and endure with the facts that I had this place to stay and no time to look for somewhere else. So, I decided (had to) to endure it.  \n",
            "The disappointment come from the apartment itself, it is an old unit within an old and decaying building.  The building is the decaying unit of the neighborhood. The hallways and stairways have a dirty looking carpet and a rare smell. The apartment looks no clean – I let the people in the office know about my perception from the beginning. I realized that the age and wore of the apartment make impossible to be clean and/or appears clean, the floor is scratched, the kitchenette and kitchenette sink are old, stained  and wore.  The windows are rusty and dusty; the apartment is due for a refurbishment. Pictures posted at the site do not reflect this.\n",
            "The internet signal, after logging in with the provided password, is weak, unstable and nonfunctional. It looks that the router is somewhere in the building far away from the apartment. This was constant for the 5 days of my stay. Looking at comments from previous users, this internet access and functionality problem looks to be a constant old problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Nice place, great location, very smooth check in even though we came very late\n",
            "- The studio is pretty basic. The best thing about this place is the location, which is fabulous-- easy walk to the river, Newbury street, T, etc! Bernie was very responsive to our messages before and during our stay. Unfortunately the wifi never worked, he had the company come out and try to fix it but we couldn't connect with a PC, Mac, phone or iPad.\n",
            "- Would not stay again until the following are addressed:\n",
            "-Upgrade sheets and towels- the ones provided were very rough\n",
            "-Running water in the shower- the hot water dripped a considerable amount of water constantly\n",
            "-A shower curtain liner is added\n",
            "-Pictures of the kitchenette are posted on the listing- the sink and stove are virtually unusable \n",
            "-More cups are provided- we purchased our own plastic cups\n",
            "-The rickety chairs are replaced\n",
            "-Decor is updated\n",
            "\n",
            "If these issues are addressed I would stay with Bernie again. You are 100% paying for location with this listing- stunning location on Beacon Street, very quiet, relatively easy key pickup (~10 min walk from pickup to studio) and the space is quite roomy for a studio. \n",
            "- Bernie was great with responding to the questions I had before our stay. The apartment is located in a great area of Back Bay where it's quiet for a good night's rest, but still close to the T as well as many restaurants and shops. \n",
            "- bernie was a great (URL HIDDEN) and description was accurate.  the neighborhood and location was great.  we were able to walk to 95% of everything we did, restaurants nearby, convenience store nearby, bars, etc.  as a 1st timer to boston, this was a great place to stay and a fraction of the cost of a hotel.  would definately stay there again.  thanks bernie.\n",
            "- Bernie is very professional and great to work with. The location can't be beat for the rate.\n",
            "- after coming to the apartment last afternoon,we just put our luggages in the room and went outside to purchase some necessities. we did not have a careful check on the apartment. \n",
            "we went back in the evening,and found that the sanitary conditions are terrible……\n",
            "the couch is full of trash,the cabinet is smelly,the pan is oily,the bathroom is very dirty. it is disgusting. \n",
            "what's more, the tap water cannot be closed completely,so it is noisy and we cannot have a good sleep.\n",
            "we went to office several times to ask for help, however, it did nothing helpful. we asked to get refund, the administer told us the manager was not there, so he cannot do anything because he did not have the right. we asked him when the manager would come back on Sunday, he said it might be Monday. When we came the office on Monday, he said the manager would not come back until Tuesday. On Tuesday, we made a call and they told us the manager was in Florida and wouldn't be here until Thursday. \n",
            "We cannot tolerate it at all, so we moved out immediately. Of course, it cost us a lot.\n",
            "\n",
            "IT IS ABSOLUTELY A UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE.\n",
            "- We stayed at Bernie's place for 2 days and here is our review:\n",
            "\n",
            "Check-in/Check-out - The office is located at a 6-8 minute walk from our place of stay. We asked for an early check-in and were granted the same. After check-out at 10:00 am, we asked for our bags to be kept in the office (our bus back to NYC was at 6:00 pm and we didn't want to carry our luggage all around the city with us), and the gentleman at the desk politely agreed. So overall, the process for check-in and check-out is pretty smooth.\n",
            "\n",
            "Location - This was probably the highlight of our stay. Bernie's place is located in Backbay and is conveniently close to restaurants, pharmacy, shopping places and we would usually walk while getting to enjoy the beautiful fall-like weather.\n",
            "\n",
            "Amenities-\n",
            "1. Bed/Mattress - The mattress was comfortable. The sheets/pillow-covers appeared to be really old but were clean.\n",
            "2. Kitchen - There isn't really a kitchen. The place has a stove, sink, refrigerator, basic utensils. Do not expect to cook a full-fledged meal here because there isn't enough space to do so. However, we never planned to cook so this didn't affect our stay at all. \n",
            "3. Wifi - This is where the issue starts. The wifi was intermittent and we often had difficultly in connecting to the wifi. \n",
            "4. Bathroom- The bathroom definitely needs to be renovated / worked on. Water kept dripping from the tap no matter what we tried. It made a noise all night and it was difficult to not be bothered by it. It was difficult to judge whether the towels were clean or not because they were really old and worn out. Would recommend carrying your own towels if planning to stay at Bernie's place.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Price - Difficult to find a room to stay in Backbay at the prices as are offered by Bernie, particularly if you organizing a last minute trip like we did. \n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, it's a decent place to stay given the price and the location but needs improvement on a few things mentioned above. \n",
            "- This was a great experience. Together with two colleagues we decided at the very last moment to rent an apartment in Boston downtown for the week-end and it took us a very short time to book Jeff flat. The loft is very well located near China town, everything is close by walking. Jeff is a very friendly person and make all his best to make us feel comfortable. This a very nice apartment with modern decoration. It fully complies with pictures, and I would say it was even above our expectations. The roof top is really a plus. This has been a very good surprise for my first experience with Airnb. I would warmly recommend Jeff's flat. \n",
            "- Jeff is s superior host.  He kept me frequently updated, offered good advice about the neighborhood and even arranged for an extra bed to be left in the apartment to accommodate my group.  He arranged to meet me personally to hand off the key and to show me around, as well.  When I had a question over the weekend I texted him, and his reply came back in minutes. The home was spotlessly clean and it's absolutely beautiful.  It is larger than in the  pictures, full of light, spacious and with a sense of quiet and order that is delightful after a day of handling the noise of Boston.  The kitchen is to die for.  My guests and I decided it could serve as our model home - really beautiful design. It really is steps to South Station, and also to lots of restaurants, Chinatown and within walking distance to the tourists sites  near Fanueil Hall, as well.  HIGHLY recommend!!  \n",
            "- This place was very nice, clean and looks just like the pics! The host, Jeff, was incredibly helpful and even did a walk-through beforehand. The loft is in a great location and had more than enough space (and beds) to accommodate my family. \n",
            "- Jeff was very responsive and flexible before, during and after the visit, making sure the place was a good fit for my expectations and arranging access despite his workday schedule. Jeff's space has a generous loft layout, is tastefully decorated and is very convenient for a Boston visit. Just as described in the listing. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.\n",
            "- I cannot say enough wonderful things about this loft and overall experience! Jeff was responsive and incredibly helpful from the beginning. The loft was even better than advertised- absolutely gorgeous and very close to the train/subway station. I would highly recommend this space if you are planning a trip to Boston! Thank you so much!\n",
            "- Jeff was an incredible host. Provided all the details that I needed to know about the house and checked on our group throughout the weekend to make sure everything was alright. Location is superb. Right across from the South Station Bus and Train Terminal so very it is very convenient for those who are traveling by train or bus into Boston. \n",
            "- Jeff was a great & friendly host. He was very accommodating & waited for us to let us in. He helped us with the suitcases & explained things. He was reachable when we had questions. The house is very comfortable & has lots of character. It is within walking distance to the park & Charles street & one block away from the subway & airport silver line. Highly recommended. Will definitely book it again whenever in Boston. Thanks Jeff.\n",
            "- We loved our stay.  The loft was very clean and we felt at home.  Jeff was welcoming and informative. The loft is near South Station, which made it quite convenient. We will be back!\n",
            "- This place was beautiful! We were two couples in Boston for MDW. Completely in awe of the loft-style layout and loved making dinner in their really impressive kitchen, and the roof deck is really pleasant in the warm weather. Just be mindful that one bedroom (the master) is much bigger/nicer than the other one (by the roof deck), but it was no problem for group. Thanks again, Jeff! \n",
            "- Jeffs communication leading up to our amazing weekend stay in Boston was top notch. Jeff met us at the loft, gave us a quick tour, showed us how to use everything and answered any questions we had.\n",
            "\n",
            "4 longtime friends traveling from all over the east coast is not an easy thing to plan...especially trying to find space. Jeffs space was more than ample enough for us guys to relax in a luxury loft in the center of Boston. The roof deck was the highlight of our trip. The work Jeff did on this loft space is some of the best renovation I have ever seen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Steps from South Station, we easily walked to the North End, Boston Common, Back Bay and to a game at Fenway Park.\n",
            "\n",
            "The kitchen and bathrooms are top notch. Ample space to nap/sleep on beds, reclining chairs, couch or the floor depending on how firm you like your surface ;) \n",
            "\n",
            "I hope to rent this space again this year .... anyone who can get this rental is lucky beyond words. Such a great experience in a very unique space.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "- Great location, really spacious loft with a fantastic kitchen. We enjoyed the roof top on a perfect day in Boston. Really close to South Station. We arrived at Logan and took the water taxi which was super fun. We will come back - maybe with the entire family. Recommended. \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "- Jeff's place is fantastic and perfectly located. The pictures don't really do it justice. He's extremely helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed. Would definitely stay there again. \n",
            "- Having lived in Boston years ago, we wanted our kids to experience the city just as we had. Jeff's apartment was in an ideal location for getting the most out of our short stay. His apartment is beautifully appointed and spacious with high-end amenities. The roof top deck was a great place to relax and unwind. Jeff was very helpful, accommodating and always quick to respond to our questions. Thank you for a wonderful stay!\n",
            "- Great stay and Jeff was extremely accomodating!\n",
            "- This was our family of 4's first time visiting Boston. And Jeff and Jeff's place largely contributed to make it a wonderful experience! Jeff has been really responsive before, during and after we stayed in the loft. The loft is really spacious, with top of the line equipment and ideally located, 10-15 minute walking distance to all major Boston places to visit. Truly recommend it!\n",
            "- This is a very nice and spacious apartment, with a layout well suited to either assembling or retreating from company. Roof deck is great for cooling off from the summer heat and for admiring surrounding buildings. We were mainly focussed on the convention center (BCEC), which is conveniently accessible by taxi, Uber, T (silver line), or foot, depending on urgency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jeff is extremely helpful and communicative. He accommodated our late evening arrival time with a key service, was careful to ascertain that the sleeping arrangements would suit our party (comfortable sofa, by the way), and was responsive to queries during our stay. I recommend this listing.\n",
            "- Jeff's place is in a great location to see all the sites in boston. Close to public transit and convenient stores. The loft is very nice and Jeff lines you up with all the stuff you need, and if not he's very responsive to questions. We had a great time.\n",
            "- Jeff was very easy to reach and was very responsive to emails and questions.  Neighborhood was great, safe & accessible to our interests and needs.  \n",
            "One complaint- master bedroom is right by a floor hallway and the noise from neighbors coming home at all hours of the evening was very disruptive to our sleep. \n",
            "Otherwise, great place. Lots of space! \n",
            "- This was the first time we've used airbnb but we had nothing to worry about.  Jeff was very helpful, the place is awesome, and the location was perfect for us.  As Is noted in the description, there are lots of stairs, so if you have health issues it might be tough.  Otherwise, enjoy!  Btw, right around the corner is Les Zygomates, a wonderful restaurant!  And if you end up with bad weather, it's very close!\n",
            "- Jeff was communicative leading up to our stay and gave us ample flexibility in arrival time and check-out.  We liked the apartment so much we extended our stay by another day!  The location is convenient for easy access to downtown, the airport, and Cambridge.  We look forward to booking again on Head of the Charles weekend in 2016.\n",
            "- Great place and much more spacious than it looks online. The location is ideal. Jeff is easy to work with and bends over backwards to ensure everything is in place for your arrival. I would recommend staying here to anyone and when I come back to Boston I'll try to book the property again. \n",
            "- Jeff was an excellent host. The logistics to get the key were perfect and he was there to explain everything that needed explaining.  The apartment itself was why I like Airbnb to begin with: delightful and unconventional when compared to a normal hotel room, with its wide open spaces, and spread over 3 floors in a genuine loft. The location, as others have mentioned, is perfect if you're arriving into South Station, and is on the edge of Chinatown with its great restaurants and a short walk to the Freedom Trail. \n",
            "- My best airbnb experience to date; not that I have too many; but everything about Jeff's place makes us feel we have a home in Boston. The loft is spacious, beautiful, and yet very cozy. Location is super convenient. Jeff is a fantastic host that will make your stay very comfortable. I want to come back, and I recommend Jeff's place without any reservation.\n",
            "- Jeff was the friendliest and most helpful host I've had. Although we didn't meet in person, our arrival went extremely smoothly and Jeff was accessible and responsive during our stay. And his apartment is a brilliant space - perfectly located for a discovery of Boston. My best Airbnb experience so far.\n",
            "- Three things about this place that make it perfect; the space, the location and the host. The pictures show beautiful design and unique use of space. The unit is clean and comfortable. We didn't make use of the deck because of inclement weather however there was so much room inside for everyone to relax and enjoy each other's company. We were in Boston to celebrate our son's graduation from Emerson. The apartment was the central spot for all visitors. Located right near South Station was so convenient for relatives flying in and out of town. We walked and took the T everywhere. The location was easy for sightseeing and even attending a Red Sox game. Finally Jeff was an excellent host. We didn't need any help finding our way around Boston but he offered his support and was great with communication and accommodating our needs. I absolutely recommend this place. If you're like us, you won't want to leave. \n",
            "- We stayed at Jeff's apartment in Boston with our two kids. Based on what we saw in Airbnb we knew it would be nice, but it turned out to be far beyond our expectations. It was extremely spacious, well appointed, and the kitchen was fantastic. It was a great location, and walking distance to all major points in Boston. Jeff  was great at helping us get settled and making sure we didn't have any problems. He was one of the most communicative hosts we have had. We will definitely be coming back!\n",
            "- Jeff was a great host! Texted him throughout our stay with questions and he got right back to me with an answer. Home was exactly like the pictures, absolutely beautiful loft in the middle of the city with plenty of amenities within walking distance. Would absolutely stay at this place again! \n",
            "- Jeff was very communicative right from the start and even checked in in to make sure everything was going well after we settled in. This place is perfect. As nice as the photos are, the place is actually nicer than they show. Just the right amount of space, well appointed and decorated and that roof deck! A perfect spot for a weekend in Boston. \n",
            "- So easy staying at Jeff's. Everything was already taken care of, the space was even bigger than it looked in the pictures. And so close to everything. \n",
            "- Jeff is a very accommodating host.  I greatly appreciated the flexibility with check-in and check-out times.  The listing is beautiful and actually quite larger than pictures indicate online.  The location is ideal; it is a few minutes walk from the South Station T-stop and the bus station.  Popular areas such as Newbury Street and Boston Common are walking distance.   \n",
            "- Amazing place! It had an open warm vibe to the home and the windows were so big it allowed all the light to come in from outside. Having dinner on the balcony was wonderful as well! We were able to see the beautiful sunset. Overall the experience was perfect. Jeff answered any questions we had and let us know we could call him if anything. Communication was great and the location was amazing! There were so many stores and restaurants around us that we got to just walk around and explore! \n",
            "- Jeff was great, always easy to contact and always got back to us straight away, and very accommodating.  Loft was exactly as described and as looked in photos.  The only negative was that the lift was out of operation,  so 5 days of having to use stairs up to fourth floor was not fantastic.  If we had of been a few years younger this would probably not have been an issue.  Jeff did meet us upon arrival and helped lug our luggage up all the flights of stairs, which was greatly appreciated.\n",
            "The loft was in a great area for transport, food and walking distance from the Downtown Shopping area.\n",
            "- Jeff was a wonderful Airbnb host. Everything about this home was fabulous from the excellent location , beautiful furnishings,  gorgeous kitchen and bathrooms (actually it was all gorgeous),  and the \"I so wish I had one\" rooftop deck!   The main building elevator was out of order but Jeff notified us and met us upon arrival to help with bags. The trek up the stairs wasn't fun but we were gone all day so it wasn't too bad . Jeff was extremely helpful and accommodating during our entire stay . We would definitely love to stay here again next time we are in Boston! \n",
            "- Our hostess, Kathie was waiting for our early arrival from the airport.  She was very gracious in accommodating us with this request.  The townhouse is situated right in the heart of everything.    The townhouse is beautiful and well appointed.  Everyone of our family of 6 had space to themselves and even allowed for inclusions of other family members to make preparation for our son's wedding.  \n",
            "- The townhouse is beautiful and exactly as advertised.  The chef's kitchen is wonderful with every possible amenity available and the house really is as tastefully decorated as the pictures suggest, but comfortable and homely too - we were definitely able to relax here.  There is a wonderful sound system which can sync to your online music service and even a printer you can use if you need one.\n",
            "\n",
            "The bedrooms are light and spacious with some of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  The linens were just glorious with luxury sheets and towels in every room.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The 3 bathrooms are a highlight with blissful rainforest showers and even steam room and Jacuzzi bath functions in the Master en suite.  Kathy also provides high end toiletries for guest use, which was a lovely touch.\n",
            "\n",
            "The house is perfectly located for all the sights of Boston.  Boston Common is only a 5 minute walk away and nothing is more than a 10min Uber ride away.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the helpful floorplan shows the property is on five levels, so those in poor fitness may find the upper bedrooms a little tricky to haul their luggage up to, but this is literally the only negative I can think of.  Kathy was so helpful when we needed to check-in early and leave late and we were incredibly grateful for her kindness.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Overall it was a perfect stay and my best with AirBnB so far.  Thank you for having us, Kathy - I'll definitely recommend you to colleagues visiting Boston in future!\n",

            "The location of the house couldent be better and suits larger travelgroups very Well.\n",
            "- Katherine is incredibly welcoming upon check-in and goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome. We had 8 adults and two children in this home and we were VERY comfortable. The finishes are all top-notch and Katherine made everything easy for us from answering questions to providing information about Boston to making sure we could check out with confidence. The location is also perfect. We made short trips to the freedom trail, Boston Common, the aquarium, and Fenway park. We could either walk or catch the train with very little effort. I am speaking for the entire family when I say that we would stay here again in a heartbeat!\n",
            "\n",
            "Thank you Katherine!\n",
            "- Our party of 6 adults completely enjoyed our stay in Katherine's beautiful home. She was there to great us when we arrived and checked with us during our stay to make sure all was going well. The home is located within walking to all in Boston which makes it a great place to stay.  The home is well appointed and accomated all of our needs. We highly reccomend her beautiful home and would stay there again!\n",
            "- My friends and I loved our stay. The house is beautiful and so convenient to transportation, restaurants and the beginning of the Freedom Trail. This will be my first choice on my next visit to Boston. \n",
            "- Une maison pleine de charme et de caractère dans le plus beau quartier de Boston, une hôte charmante et très attentive, à recommander sans hésiter! Nous avons passé 4 jours fantastiques à Boston en se sentant comme chez soi, avec nos 4 enfants, dans cette maison très confortable et pleine d'authenticité! Merci Kathie pour ce beau séjour! Votre maison est superbe et très accueillante.\n",
            "- Kathie met us at the home and made us feel welcome immediately.  She took us on a tour of the house(this was a \"girl's\" trip, by the way)and explained each floor and each room. The house is decorated beautifully and the description of the house on the Airbnb site was \"right on.\" This house is situated in a wonderful neighborhood, close to everything and within walking distance of most attractions in Boston. We felt very safe there and would definitely recommend Kathie and this house to anyone considering a trip to Boston!\n",

            "- Me and my boyfriend stayed 2 nights at Peter's place. It has been a real pleasure for us and we enjoyed our time very much. We were allowed to use the whole appartment because Peter was away for weekend. Appartment was very clean and was a nice and cozy place to hang out for us. T-Station is like a 10 minute walk away and also a walk to the sea takes about 15 minutes. Unfortunately we could not meet in person, but maybe next time! :) \n",
            "- Peter and Sam were the best hosts my girlfriend and I could have asked for.  From their prompt communication and replies to their friendly attitudes and comfortable apartment, everything was perfect.  We asked them for some suggestions and they gave us a ton of places to go and sights to see.  We followed through with most of them and they were top notch.  We actually met them coincidentally at a coffee shop the morning after and they were fantastic in person as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Their apartment was beautiful, very clean, smelled great, and in a great location.  We were a short walk from Harpoon Brewery, Seaport, and Faneuil Hall.  Although it was so close to everything, it is located on a very small and secluded street making it, in my opinion, the perfect location.  The next time we come to Boston, they will be the first people we contact for a host.\n",
            "- Peter let us a nice framed note and a bottle of wine (that we didn't end up having time to drink) so we felt immediately at home in his apartment.  The place was incredibly clean and tidy and filled with a collection of beautiful antique furniture and accent pieces, so cute!  Our room was comfortable and had plenty of space for our stuff so we didn't feel cramped.  Peter was very quick to respond to any questions and made the 'check-in' very easy for us.  This was a great find!\n",
            "- Great apartment!  It was spotless, very comfortable, and decorated with some charming antique items.   \n",
            "Peter was a terrific host - very responsive before and during my stay. \n",
            "- Listing description was completely accurate. Peter welcomed us with a nice note and bottle of wine, which was a great touch. Communication between Peter and I was quick, clear, and concise. Experience in South Boston was very positive. Street parking was available right near the home. Home is located on a side street, so there is minimal traffic noise.\n",
            "- Staying at Peter's place was a wonderful experience.  The neighborhood was great.  We became regulars at the nearby restaurant Lincoln Tavern.  The apartment was adorable and clean, we felt right at home and admired the decor the entire weekend.  The highlight of this experience was Peter's hospitality.  Right from the beginning communication with him was quick and thorough.  He went above and beyond to make sure we were all set and was ready with recommendations to help enhance our experience. We would definitely stay here again.\n",
            "- Peter's place was a great place to stay for our weekend in Boston. The place is just as described, and in a great area! Peter was a great host and was able to be contacted if we had any questions. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Boston. \n",
            "- Tayla and her kids are very nice! The place looks exactly like on the pictures. Raul's was really helpful and gave me as much privacy as possible. Only thing to consider: it is not really central, but bus stops are right around the corner and you can also walk into the center (took me 50minutes).\n",
            "Would definitely stay there again!\n",

            "- We had a really good experience! Christina met me with the key and was very helpful. The place was quite nice, very clean and comfortable. It was near the T (subway) and a quick hop to downtown and 30 min to Cambridge. It is also near the bunker hill monument (end of freedom trail).\n",
            "- This is a beautifully decorated apartment in a safe neighborhood, with a roof deck up top. Christina made us feel welcome right away by leaving a bouquet of sunflowers on the table for us. Beds were super comfortable, and the kitchen uncluttered, making it easy to make meals. The location was great for getting into Boston by public transportation, just a short stroll away -- and for getting away from it at the end of the day. A calm haven. We loved it!\n",
            "- The townhouse was perfect for our needs, clean, nice sized common areas and comfortable beds and sofas! The rooftop views were amazing and it's where we spent most of our down time! If you're looking in the area, I recommend this place!\n",
            "- We spent a lovely couple of days in this beautiful apartment. The space is perfect for a small family with everything that you need. Christina made every effort to make our stay comfortable.  She was really easy to contact and left helpful information to help us settle in.\n",
            "- Cristina was a fantastic host and the whole experience was great. Her apartment is lovely and she was really helpful with any questions I had - thank you Cristina!\n",
            "- Christina's home was better than we expected. The pictures are all accurate, but don't capture the charm of the neighborhood - or the ample space! The apartment is clean, spacious and perfect for two couples. Even the small bedroom is great. The rooftop is icing on the cake.   \n",
            "- Pluses\n",

            "- 2 flights climb with lots of luggage is a bit exhausting.\n",
            "- Parking permit is a must if you plan to rent or arrive with a car on weekdays\n",
            "- This apartment is very good for those who desire more space and sleep quietly at nights. The neighborhood is very residential, and once you learn the times of the buses and subway, it's very easy to go everywhere. There is a bus (93) that leaves you literally in the front door, which was great help. You can walk from/to the train station or take this bus in case you are tired of walking the entire day, which was our case.\n",
            "\n",
            "We didn't see Christina, but she was very responsive to our couple of inquiries via messaging. The apartment was very clean, a lot of light especially in the leaving room and kitchen, which was great. Pictures of the apartment are accurate, but this particular one in the listing makes the living room look dark, which is not the case at all.\n",
            "\n",

            "Very comfortable stay, highly recommended!\n",
            "- The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood was great. Christina was very accommodating and worked with us to make it easy to check in and out. She even allowed us additional time to check out on Sunday.\n",
            "\n",
            "Her place was spacious and peaceful. The rooftop patio was great too, although we didn't have any free time to spend up there. Christina's place was a great spot for the three of us to go and recharge in between excursions in and around Boston. I highly recommend Christina and her home.\n",
            "- Christian's apartment was perfect for our quick weekend trip to Boston. It was very convenient for visiting our family in the area and easy to find. The apartment was clean, comfortable, well decorated and made us feel like we truly were staying in a home. Christina was a lovely host and very accommodating. \n",
            "- Christina has a wonderful place to stay. The apartment looks just like the pictures, was very clean, quiet. We didn't get a chance to get up on the rooftop balcony thanks to all the rain, but that's okay because the living room was so comfortable to relax in. Nice size kitchen, plenty of room to cook in. The neighborhood was convenient but not right on a busy street. Parking was easy and was unrestricted during the weekend. Highly recommend!\n",
            "- We stayed at Christina's lovely Charlestown home for a girl's weekend and could not have had a better experience. We\n",
            "found the rental was exactly the way it was pictured/described on AirBnB, and Christina was very responsive during our stay with any questions we had. The rooftop deck was also a GREAT perk, in addition to the lovely indoor space (she has a great sense of style)! I would highly recommend this rental to any one looking for a relaxing, enjoyable stay with a view of the city.\n",

            "- We absolutely love Boston! Thanks to Christina we were able to visit all the restaurants and tourists spots with ease. It's about a 10-15 min walk to the train, however, UBER was a little easier to get around. She was very responsive and her place was amazing. The roof top deck had a great view! Thanks Christina for all your help!\n",

            "- We loved our stay at Christina's home. It was exactly as described. Christina called the day before we arrived and left us instructions and a guidebook to enjoy Boston and her neighborhood. She was available by text the entire time when we had a question. It was very easy to get an Uber and was a short ride to any place we wanted to go. Her home was lovely, clean and comfortable. Loved it!\n",
            "- As advertised, a cozy apartment in a charming neighbourhood. The apartment was clean and fresh, which was immediately noticed and appreciated. Close to the places of interest with easy transportation. In all,  a delightful weekend. We would definitely come back. \n",

            "- We had a lovely stay at Christina's apartment in Charlestown. The area is lovely and right by a park (and a short walk to Whole Foods). The roof deck is absolutely amazing and we enjoyed grilling out and having dinner up there. Christina was very communicative and available throughout, from booking to checkout. \n",
            "- Quinn's was excellent! Very clean and quiet with easy access to public transport and some good restaurants. Would very happily stay here again. Room was clean with fresh sheets, kitchen and bathroom were also very clean and a cleaner came twice during my stay. Quinn was prompt with his acceptance and was easy to contact.\n",

            "- Room was simple but very clean.  Checking in and out was very straightforward and not the least bit time consuming.  The location of the house was very good given the price of other places that are farther away.  Great value for a town with expensive lodging options.\n",
            "- The host is great. I'll come the next time. The instructions was very clear and the room was clean. near to the Subway station. I would recommend Quinn.\n",
            "- The room is good value, basic but has all that is needed and is clean. The check-in is well organised and the host was easy to contact. The area is a suburb, but the blue T line gets you downtown quickly, with only few stops. I felt safe and the area has cheerful shops and restaurants with food from around the world. If I am again in Boston and require budget accommodation, I would love to be your guest again. Highly recommend.\n",
            "- I got good directions from Quinn & May, very clear and they are very responsive with the emails. They prepared the room as they welcoming friends. Fresh towels are ready and the bed is comfortable. They also very considerate, shampoo and shower gel are ready in the bathroom, also Gillette shaving foam.\n",
            "I was surprised with the surroundings on the first day, not many people around after 7pm and a little bit dark, but on the 2nd day, I found the surrounding is safe, at least I feel okay when I came back about 11pm. \n",
            "The house is very near with train station, it's easy to find and I found it very convenient. Orient High is about 15-20min from Aquarium (I started exploring Boston from here) and 3 stops away from airport! So no need to rush to the airport. \n",

            "- This was a great location for an overnight stay close to the airport.  The room was clean, with a comfortable bed and there are two large shared bathrooms well stocked with the essentials .  We never met the owner, but she was very responsive by texting when we had a question.  Her directions from the airport were very clear and the key was waiting for us in the mailbox upon arrival.\n",
            "The kitchen is available and there is filtered water which was nice.  However, the kitchen is very sparsely equipped, no cups and only a couple plastic glasses.  Our main problem was the lack of heat in our room.  There is a baseboard heater but no way to control it, the thermostat must be somewhere else in  the house.  It was cold and rainy when we arrived, temp about 55F, and the room was very cold.  There is a window air conditioner in the room with huge gaps allowing cold air in.  We texted May and she sent over a a friend (who did not speak English) that assured us everything was OK, but we never did get heat.  Thankfully the bed was very comfy and the showers were hot.  Hopefully this will be fixed, I don't like writing negative reviews, but this was not a good experience.  \n",
            "- I had a good stay. Picture is pretty accurate. It was nice that there was a mini-fridge in the room.  It did get cold at night so would've liked an extra blanket or a thicker blanket.  Keys were easy to find.  Bathrooms are clean, and water pressure is good. It is not a hotel, so you will have to make your own bed, throw away your own thrash, etc.  As far as location, it really is a 3 minute walk to the blue line.  Blue Line was very convenient for me as it was only 2 stops from the airport and the Aquarium was on this line. At the Aquarium stop you can purchase tickets for the hop on/off trolley, duck tours, ferry to Salem and Harbor Cruises.  Government Center is shut down, so transfer to downtown will have to be made at the State stop. Downtown, with transfers, is about a 10-15 min train ride.\n",
            "- The room was as per the picture. The bathroom was shared but clean. The kitchen has all furnitures and staff needed. Very close to the subway. I would only suggest to find an alternative way to pick and leave the keys, to avoid any inconvenience: the mailbox is not the safer place\n",
            "- Everything went pretty well. The room was cozy and the bed is good. There is a fridge inside the room. The bathrooms are clean.  The only bad thing was the heater making some noise but it's not really a big deal. Very good.\n",

            "- Host was very responsive and explained everything well. Good location, close to subway to go downtown.  $10-15 to come back via Uber. Room nice and clean. Only downside was the shared bathroom was not cleaned properly. For the price though I would consider this place again any day.\n",

            "- The hosts were very helpful regarding getting to the place from the airport. It was inexpensive and easy to take the Subway and to get from the airport to the subway to begin with. A very short walk from the subway station to the place was simple. The neighborhood is interesting - classic old Boston suburb feel with several restaurants nearby to choose from. The hosts were nowhere to be seen and I got the feeling from a couple of other guests that it was like a boarding house and not really true to the spirit of what AirBNB is about. But for my purpose it was convenient and an ok experience.\n",
            "- Very easy to get to from central Boston, host easy to get in contact with even though we never met. Room was spacious but had a lot more furniture than is necessary. Worst part was lack of wifi in our particular room, wifi signal extremely weak so we had to use the common room in order to go online. Convenient and cheap, would stay again.\n",

The room was clean when I got in, I had few problems with the lock in the room but the host was very responsive and the issue got fixed fast. There was couple rooms like mine in the house with guests coming and leaving. The location is also very good just 2 minutes from Blue line T (metro station), you can get to downtown in 20 minutes. NOTE: The only downside of this listing is that Wi-Fi is really-really bad, if you absolutely need consistent wi-fi you should rent something else, otherwise it's pretty good choice\n",

            "- We wanted basic accommodations for 3 people with good access to Logan Airport and MTA to Boston.  This place provided that.  We liked the local restaurants and the neighborhood felt safe.  We enjoyed walking to Constitution Beach and watching planes taking off and landing at Logan.  We were able to park our car within half a block of the house.  The room with one small double bed and one twin was cramped but adequate.  The two small bathrooms were shared with the 3 or 4 other renters in this multi-room first floor AirBNB.  There was no breakfast, by the way, but the room had a good refrigerator and there was a shared kitchen we did not use.  The overhead fan would not work and no one was available to  ask for help.  It was a very hot day and the small AC was barely up to the task.  We really wanted the fan to work.  With no host available we felt we were at a self-service rooming house.  There was no sense of personal connection.  We like to meet the host when we stay at AirBNBs.\n",
            "- We stayed 5 nights at Quinn-May's appartement, the place was clean, close to the subway and the bus station. The neighborhood is calm and there's even a beach at 5 minutes by foot. I recommand it if you want to stay a few days in Boston!\n",

            "- I thought the Boston residence was great. Clean, quite and convenient. Enjoyed the bistro set on the balcony for breakfast. It was also nice to have a code for easy access and not have to worry about keys. Wifi was fast. Cell service for AT&T no bueno—but that's AT&T's fault ;-)\n",
            "- Great spot - clean, newly renovated and in a perfect location for what we were looking for. The keyless entry was very handy for a few of us coming and going, and made arrival/departure very easy.\n",

            "- The apartment was exactly as shown on the pictures. Most things look completely new and unused, everything works and is in good condition. The balcony is nice, we actually had some squirrels visiting us now and then. The only remark I have was that both beds had linen on them covered in hairs. (cat?) There was enough replacement linen available though, so not a real big problem. The rest of the apartment was spotless.\n",
            "\n",
            "The neighborhood itself is less trendy then I expected based on the description. I never felt unsafe, people that I encountered in the street are friendly and helpful, but if you are not from a big city I guess some parts of South-End can be a little bit intimidating. The major tourist areas such as Boylston/Newbury street are all a ~10 minutes walk away. The bus stops are around the corner, the train station is a few blocks up. Cabs in Boston are cheap and everywhere. \n",
            "\n",
            "The reception was all self-service, all doors have electronic locks with codes. This is convenient and saves you from juggling with keys, but personally I always like to meet my host in person, that is one of the main reasons I prefer airbnb over a regular hotel. This is not an issue though, more a personal preference. A nice guidebook with tips and tricks is provided.\n",
            "- I recently visited Boston to catch a couple Red Sox games with two of my friends. This property was ideal for my needs being that it was within walking distance to the park and had everthing I needed for my short stay. The property was smaller than it looks in pictures but it still accomidated my guests and I quite well. I was amazed by the fact that I could reach Will by phone and he would pick up immediately, and the same by E-mail. I have no complaints about this property and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Boston.\n",

            "- We had a great time staying here when in town for a conference.  It was in a cute neighborhood and the keypad locks made it easy for a group of us to go in and out without the hassle of keys.  The place was clean and there were instructions left in a binder with internet info, etc..  I stayed in one of the rooms, but we also used the couch which seemed to work out well comfort wise.  Overall very happy with the stay! \n",

            "- My family stayed in this beautiful brownstone for one night in May. Prime location on South End yet quite (and green!) neighborhood by itself. Rooms are well appointed. Balcony with a view of Prudential Center is certainly a plus! The communication has been kept minimal but very professional and clear. Overall, it just totally hit the spot!\n",
            "- The Apt was very nice. Clean and comfortable. The Beds were clean and comfortable also. The washer/dryer is great. The keyless entrance made it very easy for getting in & out. We enjoyed our stay. The building is old much like the city itself! The location is good as there are restaurants & coffee shops within walking distance. We were able to find parking on the street and close by streets. It really wasn't a problem. This was a good location for driving or using the T train to get around. We didn't have any problems staying at this Apt and would recommend it.\n",

Verder vlakbij de T (metro) en via Massachusetts avenue om de hoek ben je zo ook lopend in de binnenstad. Parking een straat verder (13 dollar per 12 uur). Ruimtes schoon, top bedden, prima centrale keuken. Erg handig waren ook de afwasmachine en was machine + droger. Al met al hadden wij een prima verblijf!\n",
            "- El apartamento es muy acogedor. La cocina está equipada con todo tipo de menaje y todo muy nuevo. Hay cubiertos, vasos y tazones suficientes para 5 personas. El baño tiene luz natural, da al exterior. Hay una terraza exterior muy agradable y sin problema de ruidos.  Para entrar al apartamento no se utiliza llave, sino un código para la puerta de la calle y otro para la casa. Es bastante cómodo por no tener que preocuparse de las llaves.\n",
            "La localización es muy buena. Hay al lado una parada de autobús y el metro está a unos 5 minutos andando.  En el entorno hay bastante comercio y sitios para comer. Las tiendas de comestibles están bastante cerca y abren muchas horas.\n",

I was there with my two business partners and we spent a lot of time in the unit meeting and working, so my main comment would be that I wouldn't want to spend much time on the couch.

It was a great home place for us to use as a home-base for our family trip to Boston. It slept 2 adults and 3 kids without trouble (1 kid stayed on the couch).  Nice kitchen and dining area. Bathroom was clean. Laundry unit looked nice, but we didn't need to use it.\n",

We were also able to cook great meals in the kitchen and have ample space to eat as a group of six. Area felt safe, as well. Would definitely stay again! \n",
            "- The apartment was clean and it worked for four people. Add another it would have been too small. The kitchen is nice and stocked. We did not cook the dining area was nice to have for work and it had a small balcony. The listing was as advertised. The neighborhood is south end but is more on the outskirts and so there are not that many stores around. Although two good restaurants around the corner worth trying. One has burgers and beer and the other is southern food called Estelles. It was pretty good. All in all a good place to stay and would recommend. \n",
            "- Great apartment in up and coming location. Property is managed by a 3rd party and so is very professional. Keycode access means you can get in when you want.

It is well located in a red brick historic residential area and convenient to most of Boston's touristy attractions. It is welcoming though not as clean as European standards would request.

We didn't meet Shawn, but to our problem with the Internet he reacted instantly (thanx for that). The apartment is a bit further away, but we knew that in advance and did not mind. There is a bus line in front of the house bringing you downtown, which is really convenient. The bus didn't always run according to the schedule, but as we stayed only a couple of days I don't know how frequent it happens.\n",
            "- My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay in this cute apartment. There was plenty of space for the two of us. It was relatively clean when we arrived, with fresh linens on the bed and clean towels. The kitchen was up to our cleanliness standards, although it was disappointing that there were no basic things for cooking (oil, salt and pepper etc). We bought an olive oil and left it for the next guests. We had one issue with a blown fuse one morning, caused by blow drying my hair with the light on in the bathroom, so after that, I used the dryer on low and without lights on. The fuse box is in the basement, in case this happens again. Shawn was willing to help out, however we just resolved the problem on our own. The location of the apartment was decent. It is about a 15 min walk from the Sullivan subway stop. Cabs were slow to get to our apartment, so call ahead especially if you need a cab on time for the airport (our cab took 30 mins on the day we had to depart... stressful...). There is a whole foods that is about a 20 min walk away. Another perk is that there is wifi in the house!\n",

The location is wonderful -- a very pretty part of Boston -- and so convenient to public transportation.  The apartment was immaculately clean, included lots of towels, a well-equipped kitchen, and numerous thoughtful extras such as small bath soaps and shampoo, & dishwashing soaps. There's excellent closet space in the bedroom & a comfortable bed. Two bottles of wine were a very generous \"extra\" which enabled us, upon arrival,  to be instant hosts to our son & daughter-in-law prior to eating out at one of the many great restaurants nearby. I appreciated Richard's detailed instructions for entering the property. \n",
            "The only negative during our stay on a cold weekend in November was the temperature in the apartment: it was too hot, even with all of the windows opened. Richard was very quick to offer help as soon as I contacted him. However, even after turning off the radiators, and leaving the windows open, the apt. was still a bit too warm. A Hershey's chocolate bar left on the kitchen counter actually melted while we were out for the day. Possibly the heating in this circa 1899 building was malfunctioning during this time, as we noticed that the windows in the stairwells on other floors were open, as were the doors & windows in some of the other apts. that we could see from the stairwells. This top floor apt. does benefit from the heat rising from the lower floors. Just something to inquire about if you'll be staying during a cold weather month.\n",

The view is great as is the overall location. Very safe area and close to everything. Highly recommend when you want an in town location.\n",

It has everything you'll need, and wine is provided :) the public transportation (the T) is a super short walk away, and it's located in the best shopping area in Boston. If you need anything at all, or just have silly tourist questions, Richard is always a phone call away. The top deck on this building is great! Lounge chairs, and a table and chairs for a picnic or sunset viewing :) \n",

Richard was very prompt in all his replies and the check in was easy and convenient. It is close to trains , shops and lots of restaurants and cafes . It was easy to get to any part of the city from this area but in the end we ended up spending a lot of time in the immediate neighborhood . The amenities provided by Richard were top class and the apartment spacious and well provisioned . I would highly recommend it for a short stay    \n",

Very clean with nice linens and great towels. We would definitely recommend it and stay there again upon a future trip.\n",
            "- The listing description was accurate.  The space was warm and welcoming. We appreciated the welcome of wine awaiting us as well as the robes and comfortable king size bed.  The location was perfect for our visit with our daughter who's attending college just across the Harvard Bridge.  This Back Bay location affords easy access to all things Boston.\n",
            "- We loved our stay at the Carlyle Penthouse. The apartment was great and the location was unbeatable. Right next to Newbury Street and public transport and you can walk all the way down to Boston Common on the park path across the street. Richard was a great host. There was wine provided as a welcome, all the instructions to get into the apartment were very clear and the apartment itself was extremely comfortable. We would highly recommend the Carlyle to anyone visiting Boston.\n",
            "- The view was wonderful. The apartment was clean and Richard was very helpful. \n",
            "- It was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. Picking up the keys and the whole check-in and check-out process went smoothly and exactly as instructed on the welcome-letter. The apartment was spotless-clean, tastefully decorated, cozy, and comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped with plenty of utensils, cookware, and tableware, which was great since we prefer to cook than eat out everyday. I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Boston and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a first-class accommodation.  \n",
            "- The Carlyle Penthouse suite was adorable, and we were comfortable immediately.  The location is fabulous - so close the Hynes T stop, and, of course, Uber everywhere.  After our 12hr travel day, it was wonderful to walk in and see a bottle of wine (actually, two - but I'm a white wine gal).  We slept like babes throughout our trip - the bed was so comfortable and the apartment quiet.  Our first Boston day had unseasonably warm weather, so we got to enjoy the warm breezes on the roof deck.  We will definitely remember Spare Suite on future trips to Boston.  \n",
            "- Richard's apt is in a tremendous location, beautifully finished and very welcoming. A comfortable bed, no shortage of kitchen amenities and all conveniences available. This was a great choice. \n",
            "- Really, really nice place!  Great view of Boston.  Close to transit. Bed was very comfortable. Place was super clean. Really nice neighborhood. Richard was very responsive to our questions. Don't bring a car unless you're ready to pay for parking. Metered street parking or expensive garages. But, highly recommend the unit!\n",
            "- This was the best accommodation we could have dreamt of! The building is situated in a wonderful central area and it is just 5 minute walk to the Haynes Convention Center T station and close to Fenway Park. From the moment we entered the apartment we felt at home: clean,  high ceiling, modern and fully equipped cozy home. There was wine and nice music, and it was the perfect start of a wonderful spring vacation. We hope to come back soon.  We had all the privacy we were looking for. Thank you, Victoria and Richard for sharing this apartment gem with us! \n",

            "Nous recommandons vivement Richard et cet appartement !\n",
            "- We loved our stay here.  It's a fantastic location, and we felt like \"locals\" there.  We walked everywhere; to Fenway Park, to The Museum of Fine Arts, across the river to Cambridge and all the way to Boston Common via Newbury Street. The place is squeaky clean and the bed was super comfortable.  Richard was a very responsive host, but we didn't need to contact him more than once because everything was just as expected.  \n",
            "- This is a perfect location in Boston in general, but for attending at the Heyns Convention Centre in particular. The apartment was immaculately clean and has all you need with a few extras. The logistics of getting in and out  were easy and Richard was fast to reply to any queries or problems.\n",
            "- The location of the place was wonderful. It was cozy and comfortable. The a/c was great as it was so hot. \n",

            "\n",
            "However, the 10am checkout time is a major drawback. While this is an Airbnb and not a hotel, the cost is comparable to that of a luxury hotel. Having to wake up early in order to clean up/cook/get ready is an unnecessary, added stress.\n",
            "- Great communication with Quinn and he was very helpful to allow me to check in earlier and even on short notice. Easy to communicate with him and he is always available to reply to any query very fast.\n",
            "The room is big and comfortable and there are enough bathrooms in the house available. It feels a bit like a hotel at times but this makes it easy if you just need a room.\n",
            "The location is a bit far from downtown but very close to the airport and you have easy access to the beach. There is the metro nearby so getting to Downtown is easy.\n",

            "- The house is very near to the subway station. Very clean and cheap.\n",
            "- The room was clean and cozy. Everything was like it has been described.  Very good was that the house wasn't far away from the subway station and that Quinn-May gave a good description how to get from there to the house, so that there was no trouble. I would highly recommend it :)\n",
            "- Our host made my trip absolutely fantastic. The directions given were very easy and the hosts were always willing to answer any questions that I had along the way. The location was also perfect for access to the blue line. I would definitely stay here again. \n",
            "- Everything was ok for an overnight stay. I didn't meet the host - which I usually enjoy doing.\n",
            "- This place was very simple.  Cute simple bed.  Very simple room.  Big extra bonus, couples of walks to T \"metro\".  And ride on one blue line directly to Boston (North End).  The trip was very simple, hassle free from the taxi service.  The airport was very close, too.  Only two more stops to get the airport.  \n",

            "And the coffee.....five minutes walk to get the cup of coffee, thanks to Dunkin Donuts. I was a happy camper.  \n",

            "La chambre est comme montré sur les photos, je recommande pleinement.\n",
            "- Didn't meet the host. Checkin and checkout went smoothly. The room was clean and had everything a hotel room has. Was in a perfect location, 2 minutes to the blue line subway and walking distance to a bunch of food places.\n",
            "- Didn't  get to meet anyone I checked myself the room was warm \n",
            "- Very good location (5 minutes from Orient Heights T station), many restaurants nearby. Comfortable room with almost private bathroom. Very clean. Checkin was easy. Didn't get to meet the host.\n",
            "- Super easy check in and out. Room was spacious, clean and the bed was comfortable. Would definitely stay again when I'm in town.\n",
            "- Easy to check in and out - even late. Didn't have to worry about disturbing others when coming in late because rooms are private and separated from shared common area. It was nice to be able to check out but store our bags for a while. Super convenient location to food and print shop as well as restaurants and the train station. Coin washing is a plus. Public beach down the street a nice plus.\n",
            "- It is easy to get there, clean and quite. Thanks. I would like to live there again if I travel Boston.\n",
            "- The location and directions to get there was very good, and I easily got onto the accommodation. The room has a great aircon and was clean and spacious. I was disappointed with the state of the kitchen and mostly the bathroom. There was a dirty bathmat, sometimes soggy and long black hair everywhere. \n",
            "- Room was exactly as (URL HIDDEN) was spotless, safe location, locking door, totally quiet, new room a/c and convenient to restaurants and transportation, ref rig. in room (maybe 6 minute walk), easy checkin (get key and open the door:)...\n",
            "If you like \"down to earth\" living and experiencing \"the real Boston\" this is the place to stay.  I would suggest letting them know if you have a car as parking seems to be restricted to residents.  We didn't have a problem because it was the weekend and no one seemed to care about our car.  It was perfect for what we needed and we'll be back.  (URL HIDDEN) seems like a lot of people have left their basic cosmetics (new shampoo, lotions, toothpaste etc) maybe due to flying and not checking (URL HIDDEN) if you are coming in...there's bathroom products already there...we added ours to the mix...checkin in was seamless when we checked the mailbox:)\n",
            "- This is not your desired airbnb experience. It is more of a hostel/guest house where each guest (and here are many rooms) has their own room and shares a bathroom and kitchen. It's useful for the airport. May was kind and let us keep our bad in to basement for a week while we travelled overseas. However, the bathroom is not clean. The kitchen is useless- not even a mug to make tea or coffee. His place is very expensive for what thou get-- but so is Boston. You don't get the 'local experience' staying here. It's not different to a cheap motel or hostel only less clean in some cases. But if you just need a close to the airport to rest your head for a night it's fine. \n",
            "- BOARDING HOUSE in Boston. This is a duplex. It is exclusively a Boarding House. The house is clean. Labels help you to figure out what which room is yours. I had two clean towels and clean sheets on the bed. I never saw hosts and doubt anyone does. Many, Many keys are outside in a non-secure mail box.The front doors of each duplex unit were open when I arrived during the day. When I got back at night, the front doors were closed and locked. My room door had a door knob with no lock from the inside. It did have a chain with a sliding catch on it on my side. Not much protection from an intruder if one happened by...Anyone could have opened my door a few inches and looked inside at anytime. If you are very independent and aren't too worried about security, then stay here. The duplex is less than 2 blocks from the T station which is great. From the bathroom, you can hear the engines of the planes rev up for take off from Logan. It's any easy T ride to Logan. My room had a window air conditioner. Your name and arrival/departure dates will be listed on a piece of paper in a plastic pocket on your room door. \n",
            "- The listing description was accurate. My room and the whole house were very clean...and quiet. However, I was told the room would be ready for check-in at 4pm; when I arrived at about 6:30pm, the bedding had not yet been changed, and used towels were hanging on the door knob. I went out for a couple of hours, and when I returned the room had been cleaned. Other than that, it was a very pleasant experience. I was a bit concerned about parking, but that worked out fine, as well. Thanks.\n",
            "- room was as described, clean and convenient to the subway, kitchen was available but we did not use it and there was a large tv with cable service which allowed us to watch the playoffs. would definitely stay again if heading back to boston.\n",
            "- If you travel to Boston and need a simple yet clean place to stay, this is a great spot for you! Clean sheets, towels, and hand towels were ready as well as some used shower supplies left in the bathrooms. We did not use the kitchen much except for needing water to drink, but unfortunately, the other guests left dirty dishes out. Other than that, this location is very close to a metro station on the blue line.\n",

            "- Even if this accommodation is near to the subway and at three stations of downtown Boston, I wouldn't recommend it. \n",
            "Hotel of 3rd class disguise in a room in a guest house. This house shouldn't be part of Airbnb because it doesn't respect its rules, principles. It's our badest experience in Airbnb.\n",

The host told me the cleaner will clean the entire room every one week. but we came into on Saturday. actually I can not accept this excuse. But to be fair, the host is nice.

            "- I didn't want to spend 350 on a hotel close to the airport for a 6:30am flight - the price and distance was right.  I have used Airbnb for luxury and this was the first time I used it to economize so I didn't expect much.  Check-in was easy, room was clean.  There was one light bulb that worked in the room out of six and when I first woke up that one was out too.  It magically turned back on after I texted the hosts. The bathrooms are shared and probably were clean before someone used them and left their shaving bits.  It worked for my purposes.  10 dollar uber to Logan.\n",

            "- Quinn-May were  very nice and friendly hosts. They accepted my booking for the same day. They guided me very well with the address. The check in without the key was also very easy. The room is as described in the picture, it is very big, nice and clean. The room also has an AC. The  problem were the bathrooms, the carpets in the bathrooms dirty. With so many people, it can be hard, but if this is taken care of, then this would be a perfect place to stay. The kitchen was also not the cleanest, though the bathrooms were the worst.\n",
            "- La rápida respuesta de Quinn-May nos permitió encontrar un alojamiento rápidamente en la llegada a Boston. Sus claras indicaciones nos facilitaron la llegada. Para recibirnos estaba el personal de la pensión. Todos fueron muy amables y nos facilitaron un lugar donde dejar el equipaje a la salida por unas horas. Había productos de higiene y facilita toallas, además se podía utilizar la cocina. Se fumaba en un balcón de la casa, así que dentro no había humo. Muy cerca del aeropuerto y a 5 minutos del metro. No encontramos supermercados cerca, sólo una pizzería. La cama es de tamaño queen y muy cómoda. Tiene aire acondicionado y el wifi funciona muy bien! Sin pérdidas de conexión. Aunque no conocimos al anfitrión responde rápidamente los mensajes. Hay que tener en cuenta que para acceder  a la casa hay 6 grandes escalones y luego una escalera empinada,ya dentro de la casa,que es una típica casa bostoniana. Vecindario tranquilo y seguro, no encontramos malas pintas. Se puede volver sin miedo por la noche. A veces se escucha despegar a los aviones. Tiene una playa con un parque infantil y mesas de picnic a 5 minutos.Una estancia fabulosa. Lo recomiendo sin duda! Espero volver pronto!\n",

She was so welcoming and very informative about the city. Since we are the same age as her kids she gave us the safety in a big city talk and made us feel that much more comfortable with her. The bedroom was very comfortable, even to share with another person. It was very organized and the house is very well kept for being 160 years old.

She picked us up from the airport for just $20 even though it was past midnight when we got in and still oriented us with the area so we would know where we were going for our conference tomorrow. She was so kind and fun to talk to that we instantly felt at home in her gorgeous house. The neighborhood was good and we did not feel unsafe, even when walking back late at night. This was a fantastic first AirBNB experience!\n",
            "- Shelley was an excellent hostess and the house is quite nice.  The beds were very comfortable and the room well taken care of.  The house is charming and has an older feel to it.

            "- Shelley has a very pleasant house with lovely interiors.   We arrived late in the evening off a flight from the UK and Shelley provided us with an evening meal.   For some reason our earlier email didn't reach her, and she was very gracious about it.   The street is quiet - only the sounds of distant traffic.  Walking time to the subway is ten minutes and we felt entirely safe and relaxed in the neighbourhood.   Thanks Shelley. When we fly in through Boston again we will stay at yours.   \n",
            "- Shelley was a great host! Friendly, welcoming, and even picked us up from the train station. The place is exactly as pictured.

Had dinner with her and some family members the night I flew in as well as breakfast each morning - all meals were amazing!  There were also other guests there from other parts of the world (she rents out 2 rooms in her home) which made breakfast time around the table a social event, which I loved.  Shelley was very accessible and answered any text messages almost immediately during my stay.  This was my first airbnb experience, so I was nervous about staying in a stranger’s home, but Shelley made me feel like a family member as soon as I walked in her home.  The train station is a 10 minute walk away or you can use Uber to just about anywhere in the city for less than $10.00.  The bed was comfortable and there was even an AC unit in my room, which couldn’t have been any better for me.  I would highly recommend staying at Shelley’s place and will stay there again if I am ever in the area again!  Thanks for making my trip amazing(URL HIDDEN)\n",

            "- Shelley is a very caring and friendly host living in this very charming house with the 2 lovely cats. When booking the room it was only published as her renting 1 bedroom with bathroom. When we arrived she told us she was now renting 2 rooms, which meant that we had to share the bathroom with strangers. Knowing this we would not have accepted or booked. Unfortunately this was not the only negative point. The bedroom was nice but not clean and really full of dust, as if not cleaned for weeks, which we both found disgusting. Especially knowing that it was rented all the time. I would of course expect a clean room and the pieces of dust were large and more than obvious. This was our first experience with airbnb, and we found it difficult to critizise being in a private household. And I'm not sure we will use it again but i guess we should give it another chance...\n",

My boyfriend and I took an Uber to and from the house, as we were there for a wedding in the Financial district.

There was a key in an envelope with some further instructions. Whenever there was a question Shelley provided help, either in person - getting a Uber driver to her place on my way back - or by texting. The room was very nice and clean with a comfortable bed. I used the kitchen for breakfast, worked a little in the dining room. All very nice. Wifi worked perfectly - better than at NE university ;-)\n",

Her home is a lovely old wooden house from the mid 19th century, with a partly sloping ceiling in the room. The bed is very comfortable. The two cats are very content and keep to themselves, but do manage to leave their hair about the place and scatter a few grains outside the room where the litter tray is. I walked everywhere (about half an hour into town), so am not sure about local transport options.\n",

However I will say that I was surprised to learn on the day of check-in someone else was staying. I realised afterwards it is cross-listed as a 2 bedroom stay. It felt a bit odd then sharing a bathroom with this other person as we didn't feel it was sold to us in this way.\n",

Before we got there, she instructed us to take a bus from the airport - take the silver bus, not the blue bus! Then it is a ten minute uber ride to her home from South Station. If you are not accustomed to diversity - this is not the place for you. We used public transportation by day and uber at night.  I was comfortable with the neighborhood by day but felt most comfortable taking an uber home late at night - much like I do in Chicago. She has cats that keep to themselves. House is very clean. Half bath upstairs by bedrooms - both of which are airbnb listings. Shower is downstairs in a full bathroom.

The apartment itself was very comfortable, it is a third walk up without elevator (but we knew this going in) so plan luggage accordingly. Very close to Fenway and great restaurants and shopping.

Todo estuvo excelente, el departamento se ve sumamente cuidado, muy limpio y con todo lo necesario para hacer algunas comidas ahí. La ubicación no podía estar mejor ya que teníamos todo cerca, incluso una estación de tren como a 2 cuadras. Definitivamente volvería a rentar en mi próximo viaje sin dudarlo. En cuanto al anfitrión, no fue necesario hacer contacto en ningún momento porque antes del viaje me respondió todas las dudas.\n",
            "- The host was very welcoming, the condo was very clean, and Beacon Hill is a great location close to everything! We'd stay here again. Brent was very responsive.\n",
            "- Muy lindo apartamento, como se veía en las fotos (un poco más usado desde entonces), excelente ubicación en hermosa calle. muy buen trato de Brent a través del correo, no lo conocimos personalmente. \n",
            "Muy recomendable. Lo único a tener en cuenta personas mayores o equipajes pesados, es que se sube por escaleras (de 1 a 3 pisos) muy empinadas tipo 45 grados. \n",
            "- My wife and I stayed in Unit 6 in the Newbury st. building.  Biggest draw was the location - 1 block from my conference at Hynes center and right in the midst of back bay shopping.  Place itself was very clean and well-kept, keypad entry to building and unit was a breeze and nice to not have to worry about a key exchange.  Overall this is a very professional setup - it appeared that the entire building is short-term rentals; places probably don't have the character of staying in someone's actual place (as some airbnb-er's seek) but honestly I prefer this.\n",
            "- Location, location, location!  This place was just what I needed for a quick trip to Boston.  Restaurant, shopping and public transit are all within a block.  Unit is supplied with every amenity that you would find in your own flat.  It's a great little home away from home.\n",
            "- Wir haben unsere Zeit in Boston zu dritt verbracht und haben mit dem Apartment die perfekte Wahl getroffen.  Es ist super gelegen (öffentliche Verkehrsmittel direkt \"die Straße runter \"), schick und sauber und sowohl Check in als auch Check out waren durch ein personenungebundenes Codesystem absolut unkompliziert.  Trotz der Lage an der sehr lebhaften Newbury Street, war es in den Schlafzimmern angenehm ruhig.\n",

            "- The apartment was well located on Newbury St in the heart of Back Bay. It was exactly as advertised and easily met our expectations. A guest should bring or buy soap for the bath or shower. The kitchen is well stocked with appliances and cooking utensils but no spices or other foodstuffs.\n",
            "- Fantastic location in Back Bay neighborhood. The apartment was easy to find and very comfortable. Clear instructions about how to access the apartment and to get around. Wonderful place to stay!\n",
            "- Nice and comfy apartment. Exactly what we were looking for. Location was perfect, it's just a street away from the T and a few blocks away from any good restaurant/store. \n",
            "- Brent was very responsive to my requests and questions. \n",
            "- Thanks Brent 304 Newbury was fantastic. The apartment was in the best location for us to spend time with our daughter and experience Boston. Newbury Street had to be one on the most beautiful streets with amazing shopping, just loved it.\n",
            "- The apartment is at the perfect location, and has everything we need. Check-in/out was very easy and Brent was responsive to our questions. Just keep in mind that there is no elevator in the building, if you have a lot of luggages or require elevator access. \n",
            "- The apartment suited us perfectly and we had no need to contact the host while we were there. This three story walk up had all we needed (except there was no shower soap) and it was clean and confortable in a perfect location! The couch sleeper was comfortable too and we would stay there again.\n",
            "- Fantastic location. Couldn't be better. Close to shops, restaurants, T, Fenway, Charles River. Loved it! Modern and clean. \n",
            "- This was the best location on the greatest street.  Close to everything that no hotel was near.  We really enjoyed our stay!  The unit was clean and quiet.  I would recommend to anyone!\n",
            "- This was my first trip to Boston, and I really lucked out finding John’s listing. Having my own room and bath was exactly what I was looking for and it was also within my budget as a lone traveler. The accommodations are clean, safe, and comfortable and appear recently updated.  \n",
            "John was a most gracious host, responsive to my inquiries and accommodating when my arrival flight was delayed.  He provided thorough details of how to get around on public transportation (Silver and Orange Lines are within blocks), although I discovered most everywhere I wanted to go was perfectly walkable.  The house is a quintessential “Boston” Brownstone Row-house (though John describes it more accurately) surrounded by the SoWa art district, intimate neighborhood restaurants, and parks.\n",
            "I really wouldn’t change a thing.  I probably got spoiled a little since I was John’s first Airbnb guest, but he was a friendly, helpful and genuine host and I wish him much success in his Airbnb endeavors. \n",
            "\n",
            "Highly recommended.\n",
            "- John was an incredible host, the type all Airbnb hosts should be! John was the best host anyone in our group has ever dealt with through Airbnb. No joke. He went beyond what we expected to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable all-around. He was quick to respond to all communications prior, during, and after our stay. Located in the South End, his place is in a perfect location to walk to many of the Boston tourist staples, as well as countless local favorites. It's also located near the subway to take you just about anywhere around the city. As a host, John had lots of suggestions on restaurants, entertainment, and must-sees during our stay. He's lived in the area for over a decade and can guide you to some hidden gems! The interior of John's condo was beautiful and incredibly clean. While this is a shared space, John is very receptive to being as available as you'd like; whether that's hanging around or doing your own thing, you'll have no issues. We can't express enough how much we enjoyed staying with John in Boston and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone passing through. This was an incredible value for a beautiful space in Boston, excellent location, and a host who was very easy to work with! Thanks again, John!\n",
            "- Fantastic experience! Beautiful and pristine hotel-grade room with en suite bathroom in a charming Boston brownstone. Quiet and conveniently located neighborhood, easy access to public transport. John was a wonderful and gracious host, providing a delicious breakfast and even offering to pick me up from the train station. Would book again in a heartbeat -- highly recommended!\n",
            "- John had a bottle of wine waiting on arrival. He had lots of great information about the area and what we could do. The room was VERY clean and comfortable. Very happy with our stay. Thanks again!!\n",
            "- Harriette was a great host and overall very responsive. The apartment was clean and in order when we arrived and the building is lovely and in a wonderful location - easy to get to any part of the city. Keypad access made it easier to get in and out of the building and when I needed to check out later than expected Harriette responded to my request promptly and provided a new access code. Overall, it was a good experience and I would suggest this apartment to anyone looking to stay in the area. \n",
            "- We had a great time at the apartment! Within walking distance to a good number of shops and restaurants. The rooftop view is a great look at the entire city.\n",
            "- This is a nice, clean, modern apartment. It's also in a great location, with short walks to great dining and shopping. Access with the door codes was easy. I even called to check in early since I had an earlier flight and was simply given a new code to get in early--thanks!\n",
            "- Easy check in and out, conveniently located to back bay shopping and historical districts.\n",
            "- This place was an awesome place to stay to explore Boston.  The location was great. Very quiet and lovely neighborhood to walk around in and a short 5 min walk to fun and lively bars and restaurants.  The place itself was nice and clean.  The host was also very responsive and helpful.  We had a late flight on the day we checked out and the office allowed us to keep our bags while we ran around Boston on our last day.\n",
            "- We had a great time in Boston. The location of the apartment is perfect, next to grocery stores,  gourmet restaurants, bakeries, parks for kids.\n",
            "The apartment we rent was located on the 3rd floor with no elevator, so not convenient for family with kids (no storage strollers), but perfect for couples who want discover Boston.\n",
            "The place is very quiet and clean.\n",
            "- Appartement très agréable et fonctionnel dans le quartier italien de Boston.\n",
            "- The stay here was fantastic in a fantastic location.  It is located just a block away from Paul Revere's home and right in the heart of Little Italy.  I had a slight issue with receiving the wrong key, but had the problem fixed within 15 minutes and had no problems after that.  Highly recommend the location and Dror!  \n",
            "- This place is in a fantastic location, walking distance from pretty much everything in the north end. It's also walking distance to the train station which is great if you need to travel farther out. The rooms had everything we needed and a welcome guide with information about the area. Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting Boston!\n",
            "- Really clean, nice and spacious apartment. Great location. The \"checking-in\" was a bit tricky. We were at the phone for 9 minutes with a rude lady, who didn't even gave us the code for picking up the keys. We only got it because I asked for it right before she hang up the phone. Hopefully just a one-timer. Else I can totally recommend the place and will stay there again if I'm in Boston.\n",
            "- The apartment was ideal for our needs. We were out and about most of the time and basically only slept at the apt. Beds were comfortable and shower was great.  Location was excellent,close to transportation, not far from the airport and short walking distance  to Quincy Market,  TD Garden , Boston Common,  as well a ton of great Italian restaurants,cafes and gelatarias. \n",
            "- The apartment is located in the charming Northend. Lots of nice spots are just around the corner. The apartment itself is really nice and spacious and offers all faciliets that ensure an enjoyable stay. As it is a flat which is professional rented out no condiments will be found, leading to the fact that if you intend to used the well equipped kitchen you have to buy the stuff or bring it with you. We really enjoyed our stay and the set up is quite and cosy. If you follow the instruction that Dror is providing to you, you will have no problems to get the keys and find the apartment. Dror is a fast responder and the administrative stuff was handled very professional.\n",
            "- Our stay in this apartment was very good. \n",
            "- El apartamento estaba bien situado, muy centrico y muy cerca del metro. Las habitaciones estaban bien, pequeñitas, pero cómodas.\n",
            "- 房源描述正确。房子的位置适中。房间非常整洁。\n",
            "- Dror ci ha fornito tutte le informazioni che ci occorrevano. La casa è centralissima, nel quartiere di North End, intorno ci sono ristoranti, supermercati, bar .... Noi eravamo in 4 e ci siamo trovati benissimo in questo appartamento, completo di tutto il necessario. Consigliato!\n",
            "\n",
            "- We stayed in Boston for three nights and were very pleased with this rental. The apartment was as advertised and easily accommodated our group of four. We enjoyed our stay in the North End and were able to walk to countless restaurants, shops, and attractions throughout the downtown area. This apartment is highly recommended for anyone planning a stay Boston!\n",
            "- We didn't meet Dror, but he provided really clear and straight-forward instructions for key collection, which was easier than I'd expected.  The apartment was definitely compact and the stairs are quite steep and difficult with luggage, but I think that's the price for the good location and historic building.  The location was excellent in Little Italy (lots of good cafes and bars) and the apartment was very clean and had everything required.  Overall I would stay again, however probably not for more than 1 or 2 nights just due to the size.\n",
            "- Our stay was wonderful and location was perfect for Boston. Will book here next time we travel to Boston. \n",
            "- Wow! What a great apartment in the best location in all of Boston (ok, that may only be true of you love being immersed in American history, love eating incredible Italian and seafood, and enjoy sipping an ale or two in some of the most interesting, oldest pubs in the country).  The rental process could not have been simpler, and Dror provided plenty of helpful tips and ideas for his guests. Can't wait to come back :-)\n",
            "- The host was very proactive is sending us useful information on the neighbourhood and how to access the apartment before our stay, unfortunately the wrong keys had been left for us but this was fairly quickly resolved after a couple of phone calls.\n",
            "\n",
            "The apartment was perfect for our stay, in a great neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and walking distance to all we wanted to do in Boston. There was enough equipment in the kitchen for the limited cooking that we did. The rooms are fairly small but that it to be expected in a city apartment and the lounge area accommodated four of us comfortably. Overall this was a great base for a couple of days exploring the city.\n",
            "- We absolutely loved staying in the apartment on Moon Street.  It was clean and welcoming, plenty of room for the four of us.  The location in the North End is perfect.  There is so much to see and do as you walk the streets and smell the aromas of Italy in the heart of Boston.\n",
            "- Great location, right in the middle of Little Italy so plenty of restaurants (recommend North Street Grill for breakfast - just around the corner) and walking distance to the harbour and Fanueil Hall Marketplace (great for dinner& shopping!). Train station just 5 minutes walk away and only 10 minutes taxi ride from airport. And it was surprisingly quiet for a city location - even with the windows open. \n",
            "\n",
            "Apartment was comfortable, fast wifi, good TV, beds good to sleep on (my 13YO son slept on the sofa bed in the living room area and found it very comfortable for the 2 nights he slept on it), fresh linen and towels, really appreciated the complimentary soaps, kitchen well stocked with plates, etc and great shower. We had an issue with the smell of gas from one of the pilot lights but both Dror and the owner were quick to get in touch and sort out. And there was a little noise from the apartment upstairs as you can hear their footsteps creaking around at night but it certainly didn't keep us awake.\n",
            "\n",
            "Only negative is to be aware that this apartment is on the third floor and the last lot of steps are especially steep (my mum stayed with us and in her 70's she found the stairs do-able but challenging - I certainly wouldn't have been happy with her walking up by herself if we weren't there to help) but if you are fine with stairs then I would definitely recommend this place. \n",
            "- Listing was great. Was there for a business trip and would pick this place going forward over a hotel. Super convenient and close to downtown\n",
            "- Great location in Boston's North End.\n",
            "- This charming apartment is in a great location--just a couple blocks from the waterfront, ample restaurants nearby, and only a few minutes walk to the train station so you can hop to any other of Boston's neighborhoods. There were some miscommunications with the real estate office (who sends the confirmation/instruction emails) and the super (who is the one on hand if you have an immediate concern while there), as well as a problem with the offsite lockbox where you retrieve the keys. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. \n",
            "- I had a great stay in Boston - Dror's place is excellent the process to get keys and get in ways easy and professional...\n",
            "- My wife and 3-year old son loved Dror's apt with beautiful wood floors and framing. Dror and company communicated everything very thoroughly to us prior to our arrival and the key pick up was super easy. Dror's place is a cozy nest up three flights of stairs in a fantastic little Italy neighborhood with tons of great restaurants, cafes and pastry bakeries nearby. Walking distance to the Aquarium, which is why we were there! Would come again for sure!\n",
            "- Place was nice; looks as advertised. The apartment, and all others in at the address except for one, are rented out through Airbnb.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the 3rd floor, and stairs are a bit narrow, so be ready to carry your stuff up!\n",

            "Good location; close to the main street in the North End and to Downtown Boston.\n",
            "\n",
            "There's an elementary school across the street, so it gets a little loud around 8 or 9am.\n",
            "- The location is amazing. a few hundred feet from Paul Revere's house. Cool old walkup with tons in walking distance. The place itself is fine. It was clean and had the essentials, though it's a \"professional\" AirB&B, so no touches of home and a little impersonal. Not great going to another location to get the apt key AND dropping it off—however close—especially with an early morning flight. Also, given a single key was a little drag if your group decides to do split up. That said, I would stay there again as you can't beat being that central to the old stuff in Boston.  \n",
            "- Great spot in a great neighborhood.  Accessing the apartment was easy and it was comfortable and clean.  There was some construction in the building that was very annoying in the morning.  When that is finished this will be a great place to stay.\n",
            "- Great place, and absolutely perfect for what we needed. Nicely spaced, and perfect for myself and my coworker. Thanks so much, and thank you for being flexible when we didn't make it in one night because of the snowstorm!\n",
            "- Apartment was exactly as advertised. Very cozy and home-like feel. The location was great. Only a minute walk from the nearest convenience store, restaurant, and evening entertainment. Would definitely look to spend time here next time I visited Boston. \n",
            "- The listing description was very accurate.\n",
            "Walkable distance from Quincy Market, TD Garden, and so many restaurants.\n",
            "The whole process, from booking to departure, was very, very organized, and Dror (or his helpers) were easily joinable.\n",
            "Getting there by car might prove tricky; (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map your directions as most streets are one way and there are several Y junctions.  I recommend finding a long term parking in the area and leave your vehicle there for your whole stay.  You can literally walk anywhere from there (or take public transportation).\n",
            "- Dror was very helpful and pleasant during the booking process.  The North End was Excellent!  The location was near shops, restaurants, and MANY Historical sites.  Staying in this apartment was an experience we will never forget... \n",
            "\n",
            "My wife and Kids LOVED staying in this apartment!\n",
            "- This apartment was a great location in the North End/Little Italy area of Boston. The apartment is down the street from Paul Revere's house with many restaurants and shops near by. I suggest getting Canoli's from one of the many pastry shops. The hall of the apartment building does not smell the best however inside the apartment smells fine. This would not be a good location for anyone who struggles with steep stairs.\n",
            "- It was very easy to reserve. The checkin (and checkout) is handled by a third party real estate company through a lockbox. Very easy and painless. Third floor of a building without an elevator. The apartment is small but very nice. The best part is it us right in the middle of North End and downtown and Boston common are all within 5-15 minute walk. Really enjoyed our stay and highly recommended!\n",
            "- Wonderful experience.  Run by professional prop management so key retrieval and available hotline make checkin easy.  Clean and simple apartment perfect for a short business stay in Boston. \n",
            "- The apartment was exactly as presented. Clean, small but cozy. The beds were great, very confortable. The apartment is located in the middle of the European side of Boston (italien). Walking distance to modern downtown. \n",
            "We (group of four) had some trouble with our big luggage but for people traveling for a week it is perfect.\n",
            "Good wifi, good size kitchen, huge fridge, small bathroom.\n",
            "The host was very communicative, we never met him but we had all the instructions before arriving.\n",
            "I would definitely recommend the apartment for Boston trips! \n",
            "- Great walkability  - center of North End neighborhood - tons of restaurants.  Apartment is well furnished and comfortable- small 2BR - at the top of three flights of stairs though so everyone in party needs to be fully mobile.  Apartment was quiet.  \n",
            "- Our stay on Moon Street was fantastic. The house had everything we needed, and the location was fabulous - we couldn't have asked for a better one.\n",
            "- Great location! Close to amazing Italian restaurants. Within walking distance of most areas in Boston, so we did not rent a car. Host left us pasta and nutella, which was a nice treat.\n",
            "- This is where you want to stay in the North End.   Everything is literally around the corner!  Paul Revere would have been your neighbor.  Mike's Pastry, Modern Pastry, Ernesto's Pizza, Anthony's by the Waterfront (GREAT breakfast), Villa Francesca; Going Bananas (groceries) all within walking distance.  My family and I walked to our destinations 90% of the time. Beds are comfortable.  My family of 4 fit perfectly but we could have squeezed in one more easily.  Dror was accessible for even mundane questions.  Thank you, Dror for opening your home to us.  Awesome!\n",
            "- Tres bonne localisation a quelques pas d un quartier annime mais aussi du centre historique. Comme dans tout Boston le stationnement de la voiture est difficile en particulier dans ce quartier avec la proximite des departs des excursions nautiques ...\n",
            "- The neighborhood is great.  We liked the proximity of the Boston (URL HIDDEN) need to go to Whole Foods for fresh vegetables and meats. We walked almost everywhere and used the MBTA when we wanted to go to Cambridge and the Museum of Fine Arts. \n",
            "For those who don't want to drive into Boston, we recommend taking the ferry from Hingham or Salem. We parked in the Hingham Wharf parking for $4 a day for three days.  Certainly beats parking in the North End!\n",
            "- Communication, booking and the appartment were all good. The location is simply great, your near to some really good restaurants, not far from the harbour and whale watching, not far from the airport and not far to explore the city itaelf. The only negativ poibt was, that the appartment was not yet ready at 2pm when we arrived and the cleaning was still going on. everything else was fine. But be aware, that the appartment is not huge in size and on the 3rd floor, with all our luggage it was quite cramped.\n",
            "- Excellent. Spotlessly clean. Very good quality bed linens made a huge difference. AC was already on when we arrived, which was a nice touch on a very hot day. The North End, as always, wonderful. Thank you for a very pleasant stay. \n",
            "- Had some pasta and Nutella for us when we arrived, overall a great spot in Little Italy, but smaller than the pictures show it to be.\n",
            "- Ann was prestative to all my questions and situations. Made last hour booking very much appreciated.\n",
            "- I start with the good things. Ann (owner/manager) was extremely responsive to my messages. I had a private room in a unit shared with three others who were polite and friendly and helped me when I asked for. The location is really good in terms of access to transportation. A bus stop is within a few minutes walking distance and a subway station is 15 minutes walk. \n",
            "\n",
            "I was happy with my room, although it was a little dusty, but the bathroom, shower, and kitchen needed extreme cleaning. I especially had problem with the mold all over the shower curtain, and the bathroom floor that was not clean at all. There was also a bad smell in the lobby of the building. \n",
            "\n",
            " \n",
            "- Ann was very compliant and reactive to my questions. Although the common parts of the flat were (super) dirty, the room itself was perfectly tidy.\n",
            "- Andrea and I communicated via email prior to our stay, and Anne met us upon arrival.  Both were great to work with and very responsive to any questions I had. The apartment is close to BC and even better in person than in the photos. The apartment is spacious, clean, and well equipped with anything you need during your stay. The beds are extremely comfortable and the exercise room was a great plus.  Easy walk to BC, Cleveland Circle and the reservoir. Thank you for a great stay!\n",
            "- This place is fantastic and Andrea goes above and beyond to make sure that your stay is awesome!  The apartment is stocked with great linens, towels and beds.  It feels very comfortable.  My son was in heaven with all the Marvel comics.  There is yummy eats very close, Fuel for coffee and scones, Thai food around the corner that was fantastic!  To top it all off the T is super close.  Have an amazing time!!!\n",

            "- Andrea's home was an absolutely perfect place for us to stay during our long weekend in Boston! The apartment was just as described and pictured.  It fit the four of us (and our 2 infants) very comfortably.  The beds were so comfortable, which was very important to me before and after running the Boston Marathon. The fully stocked kitchen made it easy for us to cook meals at home rather than needing to eat out. We loved the great assortment of books in the living room, as well. I think each of us picked up a book to read while on our stay. Anne (the caretaker) was able to let us in right when we arrived and gave us the run down of the building and neighborhood. The apartment is very near to the B, C, and D trains on the green line which made getting around very easy.  \n",
            "- The apartment was even nicer in person: very spacious, clean, and well stocked w all necessities (blankets/pillows/kitchen tools/etc..). My friends really enjoyed reading from the collection in the bookcase. Great location, very easy to get around via train or car. Both Anne and Andrea were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. I would definitely book again in the future!\n",
            "- Everything was even better than we thought it could be! Such a great experience at Andrea's lovely apartment, and such a great location to see the city. We enjoyed many meals on the wonderful balcony. And checking in/out was extremely easy! Would defintely book here again and recommend all do as well! \n",
            "- The apartment is exactly as photographed, if not better! It is a really lovely apartment and we very much enjoyed our stay here. The apartment is very clean and has everything you could possibly need during your stay. The beds and sofas were ridiculously comfortable - almost as good as my bed at home and that's saying something! Andrea and I communicated via email prior to our stay, and Ann met us upon arrival - both were very friendly. Me and my family were attending my brothers graduation ceremony so this was already a special trip for us but was made even better by staying somewhere so nice! Thank you :) \n",
            "- Andrea was great to work with and very accommodating. We definitely enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect for our visit to Boston College and for easy access to the green line leading to down town. The description of their home was accurate. We felt at home while on the road.\n",

            "- We stayed in Andrea's home between June 26th and July 23rd. My daughter attended BU summer school. The Apartment's location is perfect and  very close T green line. House is very clean and there's well kitchen equipment. House is very close to lake to walk and rub. The house is very comfortable to a family to stay. If I go to Boston again , I would stay at same house. The only problem is that the apartment has bad sound insulation. We had wonderful time. Anne is very polite. Whenever we call she can get in touch with us. Thank you all. \n",

            "- Wow. What a nice time we had with Tricia. Lovely home close to the train station. Even the huge dump of snow was bearable because of her thoughtful hospitality.  She made coffee for us and offered a big selection of breakfast options. Cat and dog were very friendly.   Will stay with her again for sure. Thanks Tricia.  \n",
            "- We had a wonderful stay with Tricia.  She was easy to communicate with, and extremely responsive and flexible.  The place is lovely, and very very clean.  The kitchen was well stocked with a variety of pans, pots, dishes, utensils etc.  The beds were soft, and the blankets warm.  I loved the location of the place.  It's about a 5-10 min walk to the nearest T stop, and there was also a very convenient bus that stops about 2 mins away that will bring you right to downtown Boston.  This was our best airbnb experience yet.  I would definitely recommend staying with Tricia if you're looking for a comfortable and relaxing place to rest and relax. \n",
            "- Our stay was wonderful and it is such a lovely apartment!  It is very clean, comfortable and spacious.

            "I highly recommend this place.\n",
            "- Tricia was an exceptional host! As advertised, the rental was a 'lovely private' space that was bright and open and the perfect place for my family and I to spend a long weekend. We all felt welcome from our first encounter with Tricia and she went above and beyond by providing us fresh pastries each morning. \n",
            "The rental is moments away from the Arnold Arboretum, and a 5-10 minute walk to public transportation & a good variety of restaurants but still feels tucked away in this charming JP neighborhood.

She has a beautiful home and the amenities were great as well. She brought us breakfast food and gave us recommendations for food near the Jamaican Plains area. We had a wonderful time in Boston and it was enhanced with Tricia's hospitality. Thank you so much!\n",
            "- The two-floor apartment in Tricia's house was large and comfortable, complete with a huge eat-in kitchen and small balcony over the backyard. Tricia was a great host--very responsive from my first inquiry and accommodating when we had last-minute guests who needed a place to stay. She also left breakfast treats for us each day. Highly recommended.\n",
            "- We stayed at Tricia's house for 10 days while visiting our son. Tricia was very welcoming and helpful to us. She brought us pastries in the mornings, and even made sure to get something gluten-free  for my wife! The house was very spacious and comfortable and we would definitely stay there again.\n",
            "- Great old house in a nice neighborhood in JP.  Large bedrooms with very comfortable beds.  Everything is close.  Restaurants, groceries, shopping and the Orange Line T.  To top it off, Tricia was a great host.  Upon our arrival, we found the refrigerator stocked with breakfast supplies and coffee.  Tricia brought us fresh pasties one morning and fresh sliced watermelon another day.  We had a great stay and hope Tricia's place is available the next time we're in Boston.\n",

Tricia was very prompt in communication and even let me stop by and have a tour of the place before my family arrived. My uncle had to arrive earlier than we anticipated (a few hours before the check in time), and Tricia made sure he was able to have a place to rest. She was so friendly and kind. My family will definitely remember her fondly.\n",

            "- Our greeting with Tricia was interesting. We arrived a day early due to a logistical failure on my part. We were on her front porch and were concerned when she didn't answer the door. I left her a phone message and then looked at the reservation and realized my error. Just then she called and said she would be there in 15 minuted to brainstorm. While waiting we checked for nearby motels and most were booked or very expensive. She offered us her daughter's room in the basement (she was out of state) and the four of us, me, my wife and 2 adult children were lucky to have a place to stay. The next morning the people staying in the apartment left and Tricia had our room ready quickly. She had juice, bacon, eggs, muffins and fruit stocked up for us in refrigerator. Everything was as we had imagined, very nice, just as we had seen in the reviews and pictures. Thank you Tricia for an amazing stay and for saving us the first night.\n",
            "-  Trisha is a wonderful accommodating host. The apartment is charming and spacious. But it's Tricia's eye for detail that made us feel so welcome--fresh flowers and fruit, juice, milk, eggs, etc. The beds were exceptionally comfortable  Jamacia Plains a wonderful neighborhood for walking, close to metro with quick access to downtown. We enjoyed a terrific dinner at  VeeVee just a short stroll away. Enough said! \n",
            "- It's very nice to meet you Tricia! You are so sweet! May we can meet another time!\n",
            "- Tricia was simply amazing. She was very prompt in responding to my inquiries and accommodated our (very) late arrival with no fuss. To be honest, the house is more beautiful than the pictures convey and provides a great sense of home, peace and quiet. The neighborhood is awesome and has close proximity to nature trails in the Arnold Arboretum and Jamaica Pond. Highly recommended!\n",

            "- We loved Tricia's place. It was even nicer than the photos, so spacious, light, and airy. The beds were super comfy and Tricia was a wonderful host, helpful, friendly and communicative. The space has a great energy and aesthetic about it. The neighborhood is safe and welcoming and the T is just down the hill. \n",

            "This is one of the best AirBnb experiences we have had and highly recommended her place!\n",
            "- Gracious and spacious, Tricia's place is beautiful and her hospitality is just as nice. We visited JP for family and needed extra space. We chose so well! Tricia made us welcome with extra kindnesses that smoothed our late night arrival with kids, including all the essentials for breakfast for the next morning, and a thorough note explaining how everything worked. We loved our stay. Thanks for everything!\n",
            "- This is a great vintage place for families looking for a large, laid-back space to call home during their time in Boston. Tricia is a kind host who is happy to chat and answer any questions guests might have. She has a cool cat named Zeke, who popped in for a couple visits, and a lovable old dog Reina. A vacation rental this spacious is rare in the city, and particularly at such an affordable price! It was worth it for us, but guests should expect some inconveniences. For one, without a rental car, we had to walk a LOT and navigate many stairs--a number of steep steps up to the 2-story flat, & a long cement stairway between houses that functions as a short-cut toward the town center, a 15- to 18- minute walk away. This is the place to stroll, have dinner, a beer, or an ice cream at one-of-a-kind pubs, parlors, and eateries. The market is in the opposite direction and is also a 15-20-minute walk from the house. The Jamaica Plain area is about a half-hour subway ride from Boston proper; it's at the end of the orange line at the Forest Hills stop, which is about a 10-minute walk to the flat. With luggage, it's impossible, so best to grab a cab or Uber to the house. None of this was a huge deal for us, as we took our time and were in no hurry, hanging around the house many mornings. The apt. has no air-conditioning, so we were lucky in having weather in the 80s (fahrenheit) for our week in August; we enjoyed the breezes through the open windows &--being from parched Southern Calif.--reveled when a day of rain came. We enjoyed the beautiful green woodsy view out back through a wall of windows in the wonderful, large kitchen overlooking the backyard. However, if the temp. slides into the 90s, the place gets too hot. On our last night after a 90+ degree day, our daughter needed to move down from the top floor. We liked the gorgeous, bright kitchen & the delightful Spanish-style bathroom, though the beds were a bit too firm for us and all were doubles, no queens. But there were 4 to choose from! We essentially had all we needed, plus the charm of residing in someone's vintage, well-lived-in home. Thanks Tricia! (I even read one of the books on her shelves.) We were content to give up TV-viewing for the week, as the one TV had very limited programming. It appeared, however, that we could have run DVDs, but we chose to spend our down-time cooking, eating, and reading, while our daughter went online in the front living room, where the wifi worked best. Finally, we were amazed at the generous supply of whole, unprocessed breakfast foods that Tricia supplied for our first couple of mornings in Boston. That was over and above anything we'd had in our many other rentals. It was indeed a personal, unique, and...\n",
            "- It is our first time to visit Boston. Many hotels are so expensive on August. We are so lucky to meet Tricia, who shared very comfortable house with good price for us. The house is close to the orange line(forest hill). Some restaurants are nearby here. My family enjoy to stay the house. Though it is just one time to talk with Tricia, my wife and I all like the elegant woman. \n",
            "- We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Tricia was as amazing hostess and the location was great - five minutes to the train, a couple blocks to bars and restaurants. Eight people stayed comfortably for three days. \n",
            "- Tricia is a very kind host. We six people spent two nights in her house and everything is fine. It's a good place for short vacay or visit to Boston.  We all enjoyed that.\n",
            "- My family and I enjoyed Tricia's AirB&B and its neighborhood, Jamaica Plain.  Both were perfect for us as we were in Jamaica Plain for a family wedding, and we could walk everywhere.  The house is comfortably furnished with a convenient kitchen, a nice deck, and lots of light.  It is also well located for the subway system.  We would definitely stay there again.  \n",
            "- Tricia is very nice and promptly to answer the questions. The room is big,clean and in good condition. Suggest not to check in at night and not to take heavy luggage.\n",

            "- Tricia could not have been more accomadating to the eight family members of ours who came to Boston from Brazil to attend a family wedding. Her apartment is absolutely perfect for a large crowd allowing everyone to gather in the living room or at the large dining table. The back porch is charming and extends the apartment even more. She is warm, helpful and generous. We have no complaints and highly recommend this rental if you are coming to Boston. Apartment is walking distance to Orange Line T stop and grocery shopping, as we'll as the Arnold Arboretum.  \n",

            "We arrived later than expected even though we had anticipated arriving early and Tricia was great about being prepared for any eventuality.

Tricia was friendly and provided us with help when we needed it, but also a sense of privacy and independence. Highly recommended.\n",
            "- I stayed at Tricia's home in JP for several months in the winter of 2016. The place exceeded expectations and was very lager and accommodating for me and 3 other colleagues who I shared the house with during this time.

The kitchen and dining area are large and provide a great gathering place that opens to a deck overlooking the backyard. There is an extended bank of windows along one wall that shed lots of natural light and provide nice views of the backyard and surrounding area. There is a cozy living room to the front of the house that is a great place to cuddle up with a book or watch some TV. There is lots of natural light throughout. Tricia provided a nice variety of breakfast foods that was all ready and waiting upon my arrival and she was very responsive in meeting all my needs. The home is in a pleasant residential area on a quiet street and is within walking distance of everything that I needed. It is a great place to stay if you are without a car because it is very close to the Forest Hills T-Station and there are great restaurants and shops in walking distance. If you do have a car Tricia has off street parking which is very difficult to come by in this area. I had a very pleasant stay!\n",
            "- The home was lovely, well kept and very unique.  Tricia was a gracious host and was helpful in getting an Uber driver good directions!

With so many great Airbnb homes out there, who would ever want to stay in a boring old hotel?  Thank you...Don and Carin.  Mnpls, MN\n",

            "- Very beautiful house, clean and tidy, spacious room, fully equipped. Tricia is very warm and friendly. Our family enjoyed time at Boston,  and wish to live here next time.\n",
            "- Tricia was a wonderful host for my out of town family. Although I was unable to meet her personally, my parents and sister enjoyed speaking with her. She was easy to contact concerning any rental questions. Her house is large, quiet and beautiful. She even left some breakfast food in the unit! I live in the area and know that it is a quick walk to a subway and a large number of restaurants in JP.\n",
            "- We really enjoyed living in Tricia's house. It's well presented and with facilities easily accessible. Tricia is very nice and gave us valuable advice of touring Boston. The location is also very good. Close to large lake and park and within good distance to downtown. We definitely recommend the stay in her house.\n",
            "- We loved our stay with Tricia. We give her 5 stars! She has a very roomy, clean, private house. We had the 2nd and 3rd floors all to ourselves. Tricia gave us a starter breakfast and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay there in the future. \n",
            "- Vores første Airbnb oplevelse. Perfekt oplevelse. Specielt denne lokation i udkanten af Boston.\n",
            "Huset er perfekt. Det ville have været dejligt med aircon.\n",
            "Vi har altid tidligere boet på hotel. Det er slut nu !!\n",
            "Det er sandsynligvis for dyrt at vælge Airbnb for enkelte nætter pga udgift til rengøring.\n",
            "- Tricia's house is cozy and very beautiful and had everything my family needed. Tricia was a very welcoming and accommodating host.  She made sure we had extra fans since it was especially warm in mid-July. We enjoyed the starter breakfast she provided. The house is in a great location close to restaurants and a pond that is great for running. \n",
            "- We wanted a location in Jamaica Plain and were very pleased with this apartment.  Tricia was gracious, warm and welcoming and was always very accessible if we had questions.  We loved the proximity both to the T and bus line, and had a great time exploring the many interesting shops and restaurants along South and Centre Streets.  The old homes in the neighborhood are beautiful,  if a little worn, and are full of Boston charm and history. This apartment is basic but is comfortable, private and very clean and has plenty of space to spread out. \n",
            " Our stay coincided with a major hot spell so we were grateful for the bedroom window A/C units, newly installed.  \n",
            " The house and neighborhood are charming but, as in all urban areas, if we were out at night, we were cautious as we walked home from the T--or we used an Uber. \n",
            " Having the option of preparing meals in the kitchen was a big plus.  The kitchen was not fancy but we had everything we needed to make a good meal.  Two grocery stores were close by.  We appreciated the starter breakfast that Tricia provided. Laundry facilities and off street parking also made life comfortable. \n",
            " We unreservedly recommend this listing. It was truly a great home for our Boston vacation. \n",
            "- Tricia made us feel very welcome in her home. The location was perfect for easy access into downtown Boston. The house/apartment had all the things we needed to make our stay comfortable. We would definitely recommended it to our friends.\n",
            "- Tricia is a kind and considerate host with a fantastic home in the suburbs of Boston close to the Arboretum.  Her home is split into two with one side being her private accommodation and the other a 4 bed apartment on two floors. She left breakfast items for us and was there to meet and greet us. An excellent stay, which really felt like home from home. Would return if ever in Boston again.Thank you so much, Tricia.\n",
            "- Tricia's sfeervolle appartement voldeed helemaal aan de beschrijving en aan onze verwachtingen. Tricia was erg gastvrij en behulpzaam. Het was erg ruim en gezellig ingericht. De locatie in Jamaica Plain bleek ideaal, 5 minuten lopen naar het station en ook nog op loopafstand van gezellige restaurantjes. \n",
            "- Tricias Haus ist riesig und gemütlich. Vier Schlafzimmer sind vorhanden, drei davon mit Klimaanlage, eines der oberen Schlafzimmer ist ein echt großer Raum. Die Küche ist ebenfalls sehr geräumig und mit Herd, Mikrowelle, Spülmaschine, Kaffeemaschine, Toaster etc. ausgestattet. Man kann an einem großen Tisch oder auch draußen auf einem kleinen Balkon sitzen. Das Haus ist sehr ruhig gelegen, ein toller Park (Arnold Arboretum) ist in der Nähe zum Spazierengehen oder Joggen. Internet und Fernseher funktionieren einwandfrei, ein großer Vorteil bei längeren USA-Aufenthalten: Waschmaschine und Trockner im Keller. Der Weg zur Forest Hill U-Bahnstation dauert etwa fünf Minuten, von dort ist man in zwanzig bis dreißig Minuten in der Innenstadt. Auf der Washington Street hinter der Station gibt es diverse Lokale, zwei Supermärkte sind fußläufig erreichbar. Tricia ist sehr nett und antwortete stets prompt auf unsere Emails. Wir können einen Aufenthalt in ihrem Haus nur empfehlen und würden selber bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt dorthin zurückkehren.\n",
            "- Tricia was responsive and friendly. We arrived late on the day of check in and she still met us to give us a short introduction of her place. \n",
            "\n",
            "Her place was neat and clean as advertised. It's technically not an entire apartment as she lives on the first floor, but it totally feels like one. You have direct private access to the 2nd floor, and have the entire 2nd and 3rd storey to yourself, complete with a kitchen. \n",
            "\n",
            "Location is great for the price. A short 5-7 min walk to the train station gets you to downtown in 25-30 min. \n",

            "Only con was that there's only 1 toilet. But that's something we already knew before booking the apartment. \n",

            "Overall an enjoyable stay that was value for money. Would do it again!\n",
            "- We were a group of 9 coming to the Boston area to spend the weekend and Tricia's place was exactly what we needed. Easily able to handle all of us and there is lots of rooms for everyone. The kitchen is a perfect communal area. Tricia met us on our arrival and gave us the full run down and provided some info that we could refer to later. Very welcoming and we felt very comfortable during our stay.\n",

            "- David is such a nice person and an incredible host! When I arrived, he offered me a glass of wine, showed me around and even took me to the closest Whole Foods market. And the apartment is very stylish and cozy. I had a wonderful time in Boston and David made me feel really welcome!\n",
            "- The reservation was canceled 35 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- The room is extremely spacious and everything was clean and set up properly in this beautiful house. The area in general is quite suburban so there's not much to do but getting into downtown is easy - just a 5min walk to Dudley Square Silver Line bus terminus. Happy to come here again.\n",
            "- La maison est très belle, nous avons été très bien reçu. La chambre est très grande. L'arrêt de bus est tout près de la maison. Nous sommes rapidement partout. Je recommande vivement.\n",
            "- Mekkin and her husband were wonderful hosts!  We enjoyed our long-weekend stay in Boston, and the room was a perfect fit for us!  The house was clean and quiet and Mekkin included thoughtful touches to ensure we felt welcome and comfortable!  Would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Boston!\n",
            "- I really enjoyed my stay! Beautiful house and nice people. Besas the dog is fun to be around. There was a key mishap but Rashiek dealt with it very well. Thanks again!\n",
            "- Mekkin was very accommodating. Our requests were immediately addressed. The room was a good size, and the bed and futon were comfortable. The location was good, and we could reach downtown quickly. Overall, it was a good experience.\n",
            "- Il y a eu de la confusion dans l'heure d'arrivée. Dans nos échanges de communication, nous avions demandé si c'était possible d'arriver plus tôt (13h) et ça semblait ok. C'est par la suite que nous avons compris que un \"early-check in\" voulait dire 16h.  Nous avons été accueillis par un chien aboyant à travers la porte. Nous avons réveillé Mekkin qui dormait puisqu'elle travaillait la nuit précédente.\n",
            "\n",
            "En dehors de ce mal-entendu, Mekkin a été très courtoise. Notre chambre était très spacieuse et très propre.  La maison est charmante avec son architecture impressionnante.  Le quartier n'offre pas beaucoup de services mais la maison est située à 5 minutes à pied des transport en commun qui sont très efficaces à Boston. C'est un bon rapport qualité prix pour Boston.\n",
            "- Beautiful home! The hosts were very kind, not around much, but we were able to come and go as we please. It's a short walk to the bus station. No complaints! \n",
            "- Mekkin gave us an \"early\" check in, which make our trip to Boston much easier, since we don't have to carry our luggages for long hours while walking in downtown and could put them indoor first. Also, Mekkin set everything right up for us, which makes the stay really comfortable. (BTW, the bathroom is pretty clean.) For Mekkin and her husband are really nice and friendly people and a comfortable room in good location(silver line: dudley or orange line: ruggle), I'd like to recommend it to all of you guys travelling to Boston.\n",
            "- It was a pleasure staying with Mekkin and her husband.  They were both very personable and were very understanding hosts.    I would gladly stay with them again if I found myself back in Boston.\n",
            "- The house was simple to find and Mekkin was accommodating to dropping off luggage prior to check in. I didn't have a chance to meet Mekkin until my final day, however her husband checked me in and was very kind and welcoming.  The room was just as described in the listing!  This is a great place if you're looking to save money staying a bit out of the heart of the city.\n",
            "- Mekkin was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay at her place in Boston very much. The room was comfortable and spacious, and it was a beaufitul house. The location was great for me, the public transportation was convenient, and easy to comute to the main part of the city. I would recommend her place to my friends, if they have a chance to visit Boston. \n",
            "- I had a great stay at Mekkin and her husband's house. The room was just a advertised, spacious, pretty, neat, and equipped with a very comfy bed, I slept like a baby ! The place is just a five minute walk away from the silver line so it made moving around easy. Overall very good experience ! \n",
            "- Mekkin (pronounced McKeen) met me somewhat late in the evening. Very nice of her to stay up and show me around. The room was great, very comfortable bed, and was really impressed with what they are doing inside. (They have an old 3 story Victorian style home they are renovating. The bathrooms, kitchen, and some of the bedrooms have been redone and are beautiful, and the rest are sure to follow. Don't be fooled by the outside appearance of the house. The inside of the house is great, and only getting better!) Her husband, Rashiek (sp?)  is a great guy! Really friendly, and helpful with suggestions with transit  questions, places to eat, or things to do. (He is kind of the social one, and Mekkin is very nice, but she stays to herself a bit more.) They have a dog that looks imposing, but is a SWEETHEART, once she smells you, once you get introduced to her. (yeah, she is REALLY imposing the way she rolls on her back and wants you to rub her tummy :-)\n",
            "\n",
            "I was visiting my daughter, who is attending Northeastern. This place is perfectly located if you have a kid staying at NEU. The walk to Dudley bus station is 5 minutes, if that. The ride to Ruggles Station is 5 minutes, max. Super easy. Super quick. Super cheap.\n",
            "\n",
            "So the house is great, they are great, the dog is great, everything is cool, and/but I want to tell you about the neighborhood, just so you're clear about what to expect. \n",
            "\n",
            "The neighborhood used to be pretty rough, from what I was told, but has definitely turned the corner. It is a black neighborhood, and I am white, and I felt totally comfortable. I walked to and from the bus stop, and the bus station many times, and was totally comfortable. But you need to make that decision based on your own comfort level. The house is about 4 blocks from the Dudley Bus terminal, and is an easy walk in both directions, even though you are coming back up a small hill on your way back from the station or the bus stop.  (There is a phenomenal sub sandwich place called Joe's just a couple of short blocks away. They have great coffee, too.) I walked at all hours, and was fine, but if I was a single woman, I'd probably feel more comfortable taking a taxi or Uber after 9, but that's just my opinion.\n",
            "\n",
            "In closing, if you want to stay in a nice home, with very nice down to earth, hard working people, then by all means, stay here. If you do not need to have places to walk to for entertainment, or things like that, then stay here. It is well priced, comfortable, safe, clean, and welcoming. \n",

            "- Mekkin and her husband were lovely and very welcoming. Their home was beautiful, 5 of us stayed in a room which was large and the beds were extremely comfortable! The listing was very accurate. Only a 5 minute walk from the bus station, very easy to get public transport into the centre of Boston. Their dog was also lovely, very well trained, and didn't bother you if you told it to leave! They also had tea, a coffee machine, and a little fridge for the guests which was a nice extra. I would definitely recommend their place.\n",
            "- We felt very welcomed instantly when we arrived, and we could leave our luggage even if we were about 8 hours too early. The room was clean and looked the same as in the pictures. \n",

            "- It was very nice to stay at Mekkin place. They provided us with everything we needed, including towels, laundry, and even coffee :)  We lived in a big room with a comfortable bed, and had our own fridge and microwave, which is very handy. It's very convenient located - within a 5-10 mins walk there are a couple of bus stops that serve buses going to Cambridge, downtown, Museum of Fine Arts, etc. The neighborhood is very diverse, but seems to be very safe. Thank you, Mekkin and Sheek!\n",
            "- Thank you so much for hosting, Mekkin had been trying hard to let us check in earlier despite her busy work, which saved us a lot of troubles with all the baggage,  and she responds to messages quickly.  The house was as neat as the pictures showed,  bath towels were provided,  and the dog was very cute and well trainee. \n",
            "Last but not least,  congratulations and we look forward to the new born baby.\n",
            "- Howdy Folks- myself and two colleagues booked the large room for a weekend trip to Boston (two more joined at the last minute and were able to book another room in the house, which was super cool of Mekkin to have for us on short notice). The room is huge and could have easily of fit all five of us in hindsight. Mekkin and the newest member of family greeted us upon arrival, and check in was effortless. The right amount of 'there if you need me, but gone if you don't'. The location is walking distance to public transit and you HAVE to try the Haley House Cafe which is close by.  Overall, an amazing weekend in Boston in a super cool place. Thank you -\n",
            "- Big room which can contain 4 people to stay in. This is the first time I rent a room in Airbnb, and I have a good experience. Thanks for the beautiful family.\n",
            "- Mekkin and her husband were very welcoming. Their house is beautiful and our room was comfy and clean. We definitely recommend staying there.\n",
            "- Mekkin is such a nice lady even though we did't meet a lot. They offered us a cozy and nice room for our fall break. The room had enough space to accommodate four or even five people. The mattress is so soft that we spent more time on bed then usual. The doggy is really cute but a little bit shy.  The bathroom is warm and shower is great.  Thanks to Mekkin, we had a great experience in Boston.\n",
            "- Mekkin and her family were very welcoming and we enjoyed our stay. The room was exactly as described and the location is close to transportation. We would definitely stay there again.\n",

            "- Nicolo's home is like an art gallery. It's different and unique. He is very easy to deal with and was always flexible to ensure our comfort. We had a great time and highly recommend it. Thanks \n",
            "- Booked this beautiful historical home as a 'home base' meeting point for myself and three colleagues during a recent visit to Boston.  The accommodations were perfect for our purposes and the host was fantastic in letting us arrive early and depart late.  I will definitely stay here again when circumstances permit.  Thanks Nicolo!\n",
            "- The house is great. Very close to public transportation and Boston downtown. Wholefood is just a few minute walk. We had a very nice stay during our business trip.\n",
            "- Nicolo was great to work with on booking and helped our group feel comfortable and welcomed at the property. We stayed on a business trip so did not spend a great deal of time at the home but the location was great. This is a quaint old home in the middle of everything in Boston, style is true to the historic Boston feel. \n",
            "- Nicolo's house is wonderful and unique! The rooms are very comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need. The location is very convenient and we really appreciated the possibility of using his bicycles. Nicolo was also very helpful! Thank you!\n",
            "- We were met on arrival by Blaire, the property manager. He gave us all information on how everything ran at the property. Blaire was extremely helpful and accommodating. Nicolo the host was away on business, so we didn't get to meet him, but he kept in touch regularly, wishing us well on our trip and stay in Boston. We would definitely recommend Nicolo's home. Bautiful historic home, walking distance to Central Boston and historical sights. Thank you guys for letting us stay in your lovely home. Kaye, Tasmania Aust.\n",

            "Overall, a BIG thumbs up to Nicolo and Blair!!\n",
            "- Nicolo's place was great! He gave clear communication for an easy key pickup, and there was a detailed house guide. There were three of us traveling for work, and it was nice to all be together in the charming kitchen and shared area, while having our own bedrooms and full bathrooms. The space heaters worked great on a cold night. There weren't full supplies (shampoo, etc) in every bathroom, so you may want to bring your own. This was such a lovely house in a quaint neighborhood, and a nice alternative to a hotel. \n",
            "- This house is a wonderful piece of colonial Boston history - full of beautiful furniture and artworks. Gorgeous wooden floors throughout. Location is fantastic - a short walk over the bridge to Boston centre and easy access to the subway. Everything as described. Sadly we did not get to meet Nicolo during our short stay but he was extremely helpful and responsive via mail throughout the booking and stay and everything went according to plan.\n",
            "- La casa es increíble. Nos sentimos muy cómodos. Los espacios son amplios y muy acogedores, la decoración es excelente. Las recámaras son amplias y bien iluminadas.

            "- Loved the house, Location was excellent, The house had everything that we needed, Nic emailed all instructions and nothing was a problem, Neighbourhood is a gem and just loved the architecture around the area, and the local pub just down the road was great. I would stay here again if we get a chance to travel from New Zealand.  \n",
            "- Heerlijk herenhuis, in koloniale stijl! Fantastische lokatie, zeer goed uitgerust, warme en familiale sfeer. Dit is een geweldig \"thuis\" voor een weekje Boston, in een centraal en mooi stuk van Boston. We waren hier met 6 collega's voor een congres en waren het  er allemaal over eens dat dit zoveel fijner en leuker is dan een of ander hotel! Echt een aanrader!\n",
            "- Staying at the Grand Colonial was a mixed experience. The owner was incredibly helpful in getting us set up and helping us with all of our questions and access. The home itself was a little hard to get comfortable in considering there was no real space to relax (or at least no comfortable space) and the heating situation was hard to manage. But, we love the neighborhood and appreciated our time in Boston.\n",
            "- An excellent place to stay in the heart of Charlestown and just two minutes outside of downtown Boston.  Everything was exactly as advertised.  Beautifully appointed house with a parking spot, plenty of comfortable beds and hassle free coming and going.  I would definitely recommend Nicolo's home. A  first class experience all around!\n",
            "- Nicolo was very prompt and responsive with all of our communication prior to visiting. While he wasn't there to greet us in person, the house was very easy to find and he provided very thorough instructions and a welcome guide ahead of time via email. We had no trouble getting in and found the accommodations to be even more charming than in the photos! The neighborhood is also historical and welcoming and a short walk to the Warren Tavern, where we had brunch. We stayed on New Year's Eve and were pleased that even on a busy night, the neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe.\n",
            "- Nicolo was great - everything was easy to locate and the house was awesome. Particularly, it's proximity to downtown and local watering holes.\n",
            "Thanks Nicolo!\n",
            "- Nicolo was very hospitable and generous, very on top of everything host. \n",
            "- I stayed in Nicolo’s house with 2 of my colleagues over a week while we attended an exhibition. The house was a pleasure to stay in and is absolutely unique in terms of décor and style. The house was clean and while Nicolo wasn’t available during the stay there was a great deal of information provided to us, both in terms of the house and the surrounding area. The house was clean and well equipped with modern appliances. The front door operates on an electronic security system and doesn’t require keys which is absolutely perfect if you’re staying with people who you might not always be with. The Charlestown area was picturesque and quiet, though there was a number of small restaurants and stores within walking distance. We walked about during the evening and felt safe. We also had no problem getting a cab using the company recommended by Nicolo and were in downtown Boston within 10 minutes.\n",
            "- Our stay was wonderful! We really enjoyed the convenience of being right across the bridge from the North End. Even though it was raining we were able to take a short walk to the sights we were interested in. The whole foods is very close and convenient, as well as some other restaurants. It was cold when we stayed but the electric heaters in each room definitely keep the house plenty warm! With 6 people staying in the house, we appreciated the fact that each room has its own bathroom! However, we did find we wished there had been a bathroom on the first floor. One of our guests had an injured foot, which made going up and down the stairs a little more difficult. All in all, we loved the home and location, we'd stay here again! \n",
            "- The house is gorgeous, and we really enjoyed staying there for three days. It is just along the freedom trail, which made us very convenient to take the trip. Moreover, there is a Whole Foods supermarket nearby, and we bought a lot of supplier there. Every bedroom is comfortable and spacious. \n",
            "- Absolutely gorgeous house. It was never forgettable memories in Boston. Markets and station were 5min distance. Convenient kitchen was also useful. Everything were good for us.  \n",
            "- The house was wonderful, a unique experience and fantastic and lovely location in charming Charlestown, with the centre and various sites of interest being walking distance away. Perfect for two or three couples as we were, although the third room is twin beds so could also be good for a family with kids of various ages including younger ones sharing. Also good that two rooms have ensuites and there is the separare third bathroom too. We had to be a bit careful with hot water with six of us showering in the morning but I'm for saving water! The Welcome Guide was helpful and the owners seem relaxed but attentive - it was great to keep in touch before and when needed during our stay, such as when the oven wasn't working due to a tripped circuit from the last guests and Dorothy, the housekeeper, came in to fix it straight away which was great. I recommend this house as a perfect base for exploring Boston.\n",

            "\n",
            "We were looking for a place where we could fit myself and three other colleagues for a work conference. Nicolo's home was spacious, an easy walk or drive downtown and even came with a parking spot (!!  a must have for Boston). We enjoyed a number of nights walking to the North End for dinner and cannoli. It was a super plus that the door had a touchpad lock - saved us from bringing keys with us everywhere!\n",
            "\n",
            "I tend to come with a lot of questions, but Nicolo had everything covered in his Welcome Guide - very helpful! Would love to have the pleasure of staying there again sometime.\n",
            "- This home is in a great neighborhood with excellent access to downtown Boston.  Our family of four was very comfortable in this historic home and will definitely stay here our next trip. This is a perfect home to experience the charm and history of Boston.\n",
            "- Nicolo contacted me two days prior to arrival to give me details about the property. The house was easy to find, located within walking distance of some small pubs, places to find food and a grocery store. It sits back enough from the street that there is no noise from the very busy street next to it. The house was clean, beds comfortable, linens clean and numerous decorations throughout the house. The inside and outside are fairly depicted in the online posting. There were plenty of clean towels and the bathrooms each had one small liquid soap container. The kitchen had everything needed to cook and plenty of dishes. This is a charming older home but with a regal atmosphere. I would recommend it as well as stay here again. \n",
            "- Great stay. Perfect location. Easy to downtown and plenty of options near the house. \n",
            "- We could not have asked for a more seamless and easy experience. The home was exactly as described very comfortable and felt at home right away. We were in town for a conference and wished we stayed here the entire trip. The neighborhood of Charlestown is very well situated and close to nice little restaurants and taverns. \n",
            "- Neighborhood is very quaint. You can walk to helpful places like CVS and Whole Foods. Also not too distant from a T station, and Uber drivers had no problem finding us. We did rent a car for our day trip to the Cape, but warning for out-of-towners that Boston traffic on the weekdays is not for the faint of heart. Kitchen is well equipped. \n",
            "- The house provided me and my family exactly what we wanted: nice accommodations in a nice neighborhood in Boston. Communication with Nicolo was smooth. Emails and questions were promptly answered. The house is very unique. I would recommend this house to anyone traveling to Boston in a similar situation as mine.\n",
            "- This beautiful old home in Charlestown was a wonderful place to stay! Our friends and colleagues filled out the rest of the home, and they all agreed. Charlestown is a beautiful neighborhood, and a quiet respite from the bustle of the city, while still being close enough to access the downtown area quickly. Still, we spent many an hour relaxing on the front patio, enjoying the evenings (and view of the Charles Bridge!).\n",
            "\n",
            "The house itself is clean and inviting. The beds are particularly comfortable, and the kitchen was easily spacious enough for the six of us.\n",

            "- Our host could not have been more gracious and welcoming to his home. It was everything he described. He was accommodating and responses were immediate and much appreciated. The location was perfect for touring historical Boston. The neighhood felt safe and we felt comfortable walking everywhere. The beds were comfortable and the house was very clean. For a group of 5 the house was perfect! Thank you, Nicolo!\n",
            "- We loved our stay!  Nicolo was incredibly responsive, both during the booking process and during our stay.  The Welcome Guide was thorough and the house matched the description - lots of charm.  We had 3 adults and 3 teens - we had plenty of room (3 bathrooms!!) and enjoyed cooking in the kitchen.  Plenty of good quality TVs which was nice.   Charlestown exceeded our expectations.  Such a cute area and we were easily able to take evening walks and enjoy the cute streets.   Thank you!\n",
            "- We had a great vacation in this beautiful, historic home. As stated in other reviews, the location was ideal. We were a 5 minute walk from the Freedom Trail, 15 minutes from the Italian restaurants in the North End, and 25 minutes from the aquarium. The neighborhood was safe and very charming-close to public transportation, groceries, pubs and historic restaurants. The house was very comfortable for a family of five- our teens and preteen were happy to be able to spread out, not share beds and have TVs in their rooms. We were also very appreciative of the attentive housekeeper who helped with a minor alarm problem and had the house immaculately prepared for us.  Nicolo was wonderful to work with. He responded quickly to all of our questions, provided a lot of information about the neighborhood, including restaurant recommendations and maps to everything of interest. He made the trip very easy for us.\n",
            "- We Had a great time. Rooms Nd house was lean and great shape. Looking forward to go back again\n",
            "- The place is in the best location that anyone with a family can ask,,, restaurants nearby, museums at walking distance, dowtown Boston around the corner!!! The house is an historic place in PERFECT conditions,,, 6 people can fit PERFECTLY\n",
            "- Upon arriving at the house we were surprised how close we were to a major road but were quickly relieved when we found it really wasn't intrusive at all. It was easy to get to anywhere from this location via public transport. In addition we were able to stock up on food at a nearby supermarket. Location, house, cleanliness were all spot on although the bathrooms can be rather small. Nicolo was a very good host and provided a Welcome Guide that was very helpful. He always responded promptly to any questions I had and everything went very smoothly while we were there. If you love antiques and old houses this is a perfect place to stay.\n",
            "- Très belle expérience dans cette maison bien située et bien équipée \n",
            "Les lits étaient très confortables, bref c'était super, merci \n",
            "- The house was fantastic and in such a great location. Everything was exactly as described and the experience was perfect. The location is literally a block from the freedom train and blocks away from great restaurants and sites. Zero to complain about and having Whole Foods a five minute walk away was super helpful. Best was the bakery 4 minutes away for coffee in the morning. This was our first AirBnB experience and it was an A+ for our family of 5. \n",
            "- Niccolos house was a wonderful experience!  The location was perfect, a short walk over the Carlestown bridge and we were in the North End.  The house is warm and inviting, and the outside patio was perfect for relaxing. Highly recommended!\n",

            "- It was lovely having flowers on the arrival. The handling of our reservation and the very prompt answers when we had questions made us feel looked after and taken care off. The house is just great. Very clean and beautiful and well looked after home. We would love to come back any time. THANK YOU!\n",
            "- Nicolo provided comprehensive and timely information regarding the accommodation \n",
            "- We really enjoyed our stay in the historic Grand Colonial. The house was bigger when we originally thought and the four of us had plenty of room. Very clean, nicely decorated with classic art, the property is located off the main highway in a quiet, up and coming Charlestown neighborhood with the gorgeous view of Bunker Hill Bridge. We will definitely be back next time we visit Boston. Thanks for making our stay memorable.\n",
            "- Everything was just as described.  The location was within walking distance of historic Boston.  Had a wonderful time.  Highly recommended.\n",
            "- A wonderfully decorated house with a historic atmosphere in a ideal location. It is just a short walk from the north end. We liked our stay very much.\n",
            "- Great house in a great location. Description was very accurate and the ease of check-in was fabulous (use of a key code on front door). The only small issue is that there is no bathroom on the ground floor, necessitating the need to go upstairs. Otherwise a lovely, comfortable stay. Would recommend!\n",
            "- Lovely historic home in a great location.  We had everything we needed and were given the privacy we desired.  Would stay again. \n",
            "- The house & location was exactly what we were looking for. Nicolo was very helpful prior to our stay with helping us with any concerns especially since this was our first time using AIrbnb. Our only regret was that we wish we stayed longer. Mary Alice\n",
            "- Wonderfull place - and Nicolo is very responsive and accommodating - would love to stay again \n",
            "- Nicolo's home was fantastic! Since it is almost directly at the famous Freedom trail, you directly get a feel for the city. The home was so beautiful, we felt comfortable from minute one! Thank you Nicolo, we absolutely recommend it!\n",
            "- We had a grand time in Boston and loved your house.  The location and setting was perfect for all the historic sites.  Ended every night at the Warren Tavern for a few pints.  Everyone thought the house was a much better choice than a hotel.  \n",
            "- The house was perfect.  Thank you so much for letting us stay.  I would recommend it to anyone!\n",
            "\n",
            "- We had a wonderful time staying at this property in Boston, it is just as beautiful inside as the photos suggest and well located for accessing most of Boston's sights! The heaters kept the house warm despite remarkably low temperatures outside. Our stay of 6 adults was very comfortable thanks to the space available and the presence of 3 bathrooms which made getting up and out very quick each morning. The area is historic, pretty and peaceful. Overall we have a fantastic stay.\n",
            "- I appreciated being able to drop bags off a few hours prior to check in. Place was wonderful. Very convenient for a group of 6. Spacious kitchen great for cooking and hanging out. Quiet neighborhood 15 minute walk from subway and commuter trains. \n",
            "- This place is amazing. Such a convenient location too... Walking distance to so much.  Staying here was a great experience. \n",
            "- The house was absolutely charming.   What a piece of history!  Wish we could've stayed longer. \n",
            "- We had a great time in the Admiral Wiley House!  My brother and his wife, my sister and her husband and my wife and I came to Boston to celebrate my 60th birthday.  We loved the house! It's in nice neighborhood, within walking distance of the North End.  The Warren Tavern - excellent food and write-ups on TripAdvisor - is a 5 minute walk.  Nice coffee shop 3 minutes further.  It's a 10-12 minute walk from the Community College T station - far better than trying to get around Boston in a car.  Kitchen comes with all the necessary equipment and is updated.  Whole foods grocery store is a 10 minute walk.  Really a nice setup.  The house is set up to be comfortable year round.  The pictures are accurate.  The air conditioners in the picture were stored in the basement for our October stay.  The windows are updated double pane and can be opened for wonderful fresh air.  When they are closed it is a very quiet house.  Strongly recommend this house!!!\n",
            "- Excellent host! Very accommodating. All information given in good time. Welcome folder contained everything you could possibly wish to know and more. Location was brilliant. We did not have long in Boston and walked the freedom trail which ends nearby. Lovely residential area. The house was so comfortable (amazing bed) and spacious......a home from home. Only sorry we couldn't stay longer!\n",
            "- Great period house! Gives your visit to Boston a lot of atmosphere. Good location and easy to get to downtown Boston. Full and prompt communication from Nicolo made it easy. I would highly recommend this house.\n",
            "- This house suited our trip perfectly! Such a beautiful Colonial home in a great neighborhood.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nicolo was a very informative and communicative host. The house guide answered any questions we had and the house--from the space to the location--was more than accommodating. \n",
            "\n",
            "Highly recommended. And thank you! \n",
            "- The home is in a great neighborhood with excellent access to the North End, Fanuiel Hall, and downtown Boston.  Home is very clean and well maintained. This was a good value for our family that needed 3 bedrooms in the downtown Boston area.  The living room, large kitchen, and front porch are great socializing areas, which greatly enhanced our enjoyment of our 4 day Boston visit. Having a washer and dryer was also a plus as several in our group were on extended vacation/business trips. We were able to \"Uber\" everywhere on this trip, but we normally rent a car when we visit Boston, and having the dedicated parking space would have been tremendous for us on a typical trip. \n",
            "- The house was fantastic for our family's Thanksgiving getaway!! Very clean and had all the facilities we needed.  The fireplace was a very welcome addition and made sitting and hanging out very enjoyable indeed!! The bedrooms were very comfortable and bathrooms great (so nice to have one each!).  Nicolo and their housekeeper were available to answer any questions immediately which was reassuring.  We'd definitely look to stay here again!! \n",
            "- Great spot and it was exactly what we needed for a quick overnight stay in Boston with family. Clean, neat and very historic!\n",
            "- Nicolo is great. Super prompt with replies. This is my 2nd time staying at The Colonial. It's a fantastic place that is in a convenient location. I've had 2 great experiences staying here. \n",
            "- This is a stunning retreat, made all the warmer by the host and owner, Nicolo. The home is spacious, accommodating, as lovely in real time as it is in pictures. \n",

            "- Great stay.  Location was convenient and the house was exactly as described.  \n",
            "- This place was great for our business trip to Boston. The house has a lot of character and is pretty large.\n",
            "- 这是一栋有年头的联体屋,内饰和家具很有历史意味,典型的新英格兰风格。位置紧靠市中心外围,步行一小时的距离,地铁不算很近,步行一刻钟,我后来都打车,十多分钟到市中心。毕竟是老房子,没有暖气,用电热油汀。每个房门和门把手都吱吱嘎嘎,楼梯也是,晚上走动很吵人。卫生间很小。厨房连着餐厅,很大,餐椅很好看,但太老,都摇摇晃晃,我二岁的孩子,从椅子上下来时因椅子不稳摔倒。答应的婴儿床没有出现,询问也没有回答,结果只好直接睡大人床,晚上几次滚下地板了。\n",
            "- The building was amazing, and we had so great time staying at the house. I highly recommend to stay at the house.\n",
            "- It was very nice experience to stay in this amazing apartment. Everything is good, just perhaps some light bulbs can be changed, and heating system could be improved (a bit cold in the evening). In general, very good experience to stay here and Nicolo is so helpful.\n",
            "- Nicolo - You were ultra efficient, quick to respond and made our stay and easy one. The house was just as described: very charming, conveniently located and civilised.\n",
            "- This is a beautiful, well equipped house in a nice, quiet area in Charleston, on the Freedom Trail.\n",
            "\n",
            "The kitchen was well set up with lots of non perishable food items in the cupboards. There were two large double rooms which were very comfortable, each with their own en suite bathrooms. The top room had two single beds and would probably be better for children as it is quite small for two adults. The property is very convenient for getting in to town and particularly convenient for us as we were walking to the TDGarden everyday for the World Figure Skating Championships. The taxi to town is between 8 to 15 dollars and 25 to the airport.\n",
            "\n",
            "Charlestown is a very pretty and quiet neighbourhood with a small supermarket quite nearby.\n",

            "Nicolo was in regular contact with us by email when we had a question and was very helpful to us on our leaving day, allowing us to stay longer because of an evening flight.\n",
            "- This was a wonderful historic house in a great Boston neighborhood. It was exactly as described, beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and reasonably priced. The owner provided all the information necessary in a timely manner and responded to emails promptly. I highly recommend this property.\n",
            "- We throughly enjoyed our visit in the Grand Colonial home. It was spacious, and within walking distance to excellent restaurants and major attractions. I would highly recommend staying here with your family.\n",
            "- Nicolo's listing was exactly as described! It was very well organized from the welcome email I received 2 days prior, to the ease of getting in and out of the house with the pin pad entry. \n",
            "\n",
            "The layout was perfect for me and my family with 3 seperate bedrooms all with our own bathrooms, and clean and perfectly equipped with everything we needed during our stay.\n",
            "\n",
            "The location was great in Charlestown, close to transit and cute pubs and restaurants as well as an easy walk to the North end. We felt safe, comfortable and instantly at home in this beautiful house! \n",
            "- We loved this house for our visit to Boston. The welcome guide provided is very complete. They even setup the pack and play for my son for our arrival. The 3 ensuite bathrooms worked out very well for our mix of people. I can speak for the king size master bed and say the bed was very comfortable with great linens. We very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider this option when we visit again! \n",
            "- We enjoyed a great weekend in Nicolo's lovely colonial in Charlestown (essentially).  The house is spacious and decorated in traditional style.  Each bedroom has a bathroom. And you can't beat the location.\n",
            "- Our family has been home from our stay for two weeks now and we still miss being at Nicolo's Grand Colonial!  It was a great mix of location and affordability for our family of 5 needing 3 separate full baths.  The house was as described and as clean as in the pictures.  One thing I do wish I would have known before booking is that the flight of stairs up to the third floor bedroom was a bit steeper than the first flight to the second floor.  This prevented us from assigning the rooms to our family members the way we had hoped (our 78 year old mother was traveling with us).  A few other notes:  there was plenty of hot water for 5 adults as long as you take them one at a time (back to back is fine, just not at the same time);  bring your own tissues - none were provided for us; the stairs to the basement are very steep and narrow - if you are old, large, or afraid of heights you won't be able to make it down them (you'll probably want to bring the ironing board upstairs if you will be needing it daily).  There were tons of dishes and silverware and a very nice coffee grinder and brewer, although the pots are very hard to reach since they hang from the ceiling - we're a family under 5'4\" so we could only reach a few of them.  The dining room chairs are wobbly, so using them for small children probably is risky; but for adults who are careful about sitting down, they were fine.  We had trouble getting the DVD player in the living room to work, but we had an HDMI cable with us so we just used that and our laptop and it allowed us to watch the movies we brought.  And it's no joke about the parking - don't rent anything larger than a Chevy Impala or it won't fit in the space - and you do have to back in, so get a rental with a rear view camera!  And the neighborhood is just as lovely as the house!  I would absolutely recommend staying here - it's in the perfect location for restaurants, the T, the North End and Quincy Market, the Science Museum and the USS Constitution, easy to and from the airport and plenty of convenience stores nearby (Whole Foods, CVS, liquor store, gas station, Dunkin Donuts, etc).  It's a drive to Target for any larger forgotten or desired items, but other than that it's completely doable as a car-free place to stay for folks who are walkers.  Nicolo was extremely easy to get in touch with during our stay and responded very quickly to the couple of questions we had.   I would happily be his guest again!  Thank you Nicolo for a worry-free week!\n",
            "- We stayed at this charming home for 4 days. The home is conveniently situated in Charlestown.  The parking space is right in front although a bit tight ( we had an SUV). The emails and communications were very good as well. There were all the basic amenities in the home so we did not need to run to the grocery store. There is however a nice whole foods located walking distance away. The few words of caution are that this being an old home, the floors are a little lopsided. Also the basement access to the laundry area was a little rickety and the lighting was a little dim in certain areas. Overall a very charming home! \n",
            "- Lovely vintage home that was just as described in the listing. Great location within walking distance from Whole Foods and The Warren Tavern....we took advantage of both. Great proximity to the Harvard University. Rooms were comfortable and kitchen was well stocked to meet our needs. The parking place was a definite plus for this area. We'd definitely stay again....looking at upcoming medical conferences in the Boston area and this home is a contender. \n",
            "- 我们提前到了,当时Dee正在打扫房子,她非常热情的让我们把行李放在了客厅,并且留了我们的电话,等她打扫完就发了短信给我们,方便我们入住。\n",

            "步行的距离你就可以找到whole food market,还有其他的一些商店,非常方便。住的小区也很安静舒适,住了三天非常满意。\n",
            "- Nicolo's house was impressive. Upon entering we oohed-aahed from room to room. There were six of us and everyone had plenty of space.  It was clean and charming. The location can't be beat. Just a short walk over the Charles River to North End. \n",
            "My only recommendation would be to equip the living room with a nice quiet fan. No a/c unit and the fan that was there had a chipped blade and sounded like it was going to take off making it too noisy to talk. Also the king bed seemed to slope to the middle. All in all the Wiley house was perfect for our family trip. Thank you!\n",
            "- We absolutely loved our stay at home this charming historic colonial. It was exactly as the pictures show. The home is furnished with beautiful antiques and was very comfortable for six adults. Although we did not cook any meals during our stay, the kitchen is well stocked with anything you could possibly need. There was a very detailed Welcome Guide for our reference, which we really appreciated. The neighborhood is very quiet and within walking distance of Bunker Hill Monument, The Warren Tavern and restaurants. The parking space is very tight so we returned our SUV and was able to walk everywhere. Very close to the Freedom Trail just a walk across the Charles River. Be sure to take the Duck Boat tour as it is very fun and informative. We met a neighbor that lives across the street and watched the Bunker Hill Parade with them. We had been to the Cape for a few days before coming to Charlestown. I must say that our visit to this lovely home and city was the highlight of our trip. We would love to come back for a longer visit to this charming house and friendly neighborhood. By the way an Uber drive to the airport was under $15.00. Thank you for opening your beautiful home to us.\n",
            "- We loved our stay here! A historic home in a terrific location. We were able to walk to the USS Constitution, the Aquarium, and then to the North End for dinner. So convenient to be able to ditch the car and explore the city on foot. The house is well set up, beds were comfortable. Communication was clear and easy. Thanks!\n",
            "- House is in convenient location in Charlestown, with a nice ~15 minute walk to sights in Boston/downtown.  For guests with sensitivity to noise  the house is not ideal as there are a couple of busy roads very close by.   The house itself is charming for a very old structure and has an interesting decor that takes you back in time.   There is an outside space that is nice  on warm days but there is not much privacy as the house is surrounded by apartment buildings.  \n",
            "- Nicolo's home in Charlestown was the perfect landing pad for our Boston visit.  With our 2 kids, Mother-in-law and Brother-in-law with us, everyone had plenty of space to spread out.   The decor was charming and we really appreciated the outside dining table, bikes and well equipped kitchen.  The neighborhood was fantastic and an easy walk into downtown.  \n",
            "- Fantastic location in historic and period authentic Charlestown. Walking distance to many attractions including Bunker Hill and USS Constitution . Perfect for vacationing family who needs more space than a hotel can provide. Kitchen is great to have also. \n",
            "- We loved this house!  It took us right back to the historic time period that the neighborhood is famous for.  It was a perfect place to stay while my family of 6 was in Boston for the weekend.  The house is very comfortable and the host was very helpful answering the questions we had during our stay.  Thanks for the detailed Welcome Guide, also.  I would recommend this house to future travelers.  \n",
            "- Nice place, and a nice refurbishment of the old house.  Not too far a walk from the downtown area of Bunker Hill, and not bad to drive to once you figured out how to get in and out of all the Boston one way streets. Quiet neighborhood for the most part. Individual rooms were nice and the beds were decent. All the amenities were there and the kitchen was well appointed. In the hottest days of the summer, the first floor was hard to keep cool, but the bedrooms were comfortable for sleeping. \n",
            "- Nicolo, you have a beautiful home in a great location.  We were close to all of the attractions and sights that Boston has to offer. Great amenities and plenty of space for my party of six. We would definitely book this home again.\n",
            "- This home certainly gave us an \"Old Boston historical feel\" just what we were looking for.  The surrounding neighborhood was lovely, quiet and historical as well.  Lots of conveniences--restaurants, bars, Whole foods.  We used the transit often which is about 3 blocks away.   Even though this house is 3 stories, it is very quiet even with people going up and down the stairs.  We loved the outdoor seating area at the front of the house and used it everyday, morning and evening.  The information packet for our arrival and stay was excellent.\n",
            "- Due to unforeseen circumstances with a hotel room block for myself and two colleagues, we needed to find accommodations in Boston for two nights. This property was one of the first to pop up in our search and the quick response from the host, secured our lodging and allowed the rest of the business trip to go off without any issues. \n",
            "\n",
            "The home was as described and very comfortable. It was HOT in Boston while we were there. A large fan provided on the ground floor help circulate air on that level, otherwise window AC units kept the sleeping rooms very comfortable. \n",
            "\n",
            "There are a few nice restaurants walking distance from the home, including a nice coffee shop. A brief walk over the Charlestown Bridge and you'll be in Boston's North End (less than 10 minutes).\n",

            "We were very pleased with our stay. \n",
            "- The house is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with easy access to public transportation. The house provides a good Boston experience, with the look and feel of a historic home. The kitchen is particularly nice, with spacious eating and cooking areas. The filtered water in the fridge was very convenient, and the bed in the master bedroom was comfortable. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much.\n",

            "we highly recommend \n",

Chambres spacieuses et literie confortable. Le lave-linge et le sèche-linge de grande capacité et situés au sous-sol sont très appréciables . \n",
            "- House exactly as described. Full of Boston charm and easy to live in with lots of equipment and facilities.  Hosts were easy to communicate with. Car parking a little tight but manageable even if you have rented an SUV. Would definately stay again.\n",
            "- There were six of us in our group and this house was very accommodating. We all enjoyed our stay.\n",

            "We all agreed that staying in this house surpassed any hotel downtown. \n",
            "- Very nice home in convenient area.  Very comfortable beds, and nice baths.  Lots of space upstairs.  Our main concern was the heat in the living room and kitchen areas.\n",

            "- DeAnna was very good about always communicating with me! We were going to leave our things there, tour Boston, freshen up and head out for a late flight. My husband needed to get home sooner for work,  and the airline was able to get us on an earlier flight!\n",
            "We ended up not using her place,  and we let her know as soon as possible. Great experience,  very good on communication!  Would go back if in Boston again! Thank you DeAnna :)\n",
            "- DeAnna was an excellent hostess! She was very communicative leading up to my stay and gave me very helpful directions.

Thank you, DeAnna and Kate, for your hospitality and company! \n",
            "- DeAnna's place is incredibly conveniently located near the Maverick T Blue line stop, and also a 10-minute cab ride to Logan airport.  I stayed here 1 night while DeAnna was away, but she left thorough instructions for letting myself in to her place and getting settled.  Her apartment is kept very tidy and cutely decorated, and the futon bed was very comfortable.  Pumpkin the cat was friendly enough to visit with me from time to time.  Her street was quiet and nicely tree-lined, and I enjoyed the proximity to neighborhood restaurants and bodegas.  Thank you, DeAnna!      \n",

            "- Natalie's review: Although I didn't see Marlo, this place was very nice and clean and accurate in its description. She provided easy instructions to get my cousin into this place. Marlo and I kept in constant communication, which is a plus for me and was flexible with the arrival schedules of my cousin. I thought this place was welcoming and cozy for my cousin's stay.\n",
            "Miguel's review (cousin): He felt comfortable coming from a very long trip from Peru. He mentioned that this place was clean and organized. The instructions and suggestions left by the host was a plus for him since he was not familiar with Brookline or Boston. He also said that both Marlo and Matt were attentive and always there to help out with anything that he needed. He also mentioned that Marlo and Matt were flexible from beginning to end. He was very pleased of his stay and he would recommend to any friends and family who are traveling from very far away. \n",

            "- Although we didn't meet in person with Marlo or Matt , the house is pretty good clean and the guidance provided is quite clear and the transportation card provided is quite convenient \n",
            "- We loved staying at Marlo's place! Her roommate Matt was so great with telling us places to go and different things to see. We arrived and Marlo had left towels and shampoo on the bed for us. The subway is a 5 minute walk away which is very convenient for getting downtown. The room is exactly as advertised and the bed is extremely comfortable! \n",
            "- I am an international grad student & I would strongly recommend students, as well as foreign travelers to stay at Marlo & Matt's apartment. It was a wonderful experience for me on this first day in Boston. I have got many good instructions, advices from Marlo & Matt to explore Brighton area, South End, and Boston downtown. I feel this unique experience help me a lot to familiarize myself with American lifestyle. \n",
            "- I loved staying here! Perfect location, beautiful suburb, convenient to the T. Apartment was super clean, bed was amazingly comfortable, Marlo's attention to detail to making my stay as easy as possible was spot on. Stayed with Matt, who was warm, friendly and helpful. Wouldn't hesitate to book again \n",
            "- This room is really as good as it showed on the website. The bed is very comfortable, the living room is spacious, and the place is quite and convenience. Very good experience here. Thanks Marlo and Matt.\n",
            "- Due to some last-minute circumstances, I was unable to stay at this Airbnb for my scheduled one-night stay. But the communication with Marlo leading up to my stay was excellent. Marlo was very kind and responsive and even agreed to let me keep my luggage in the Airbnb during the day I would have checked out. Marlo's roommate, Matt, was also very kind and offered to keep the apartment accessible just in case. Thanks, Marlo and Matt! \n",
            "- Nice well-equipped boat, great bargain for the price, convenient location and an enjoyable alternative to staying at a hotel. Great view on the harbor and a Starbucks outlet within 3 min walk for a morning cup of coffee. \n",
            "- Three senior girlfriends and I stayed on Capricornus during a gorgeous week the middle of September.  We had no problems getting to or getting in to the houseboat.  We found it very clean and neat.  The appliances and furniture were newish and in great condition. The coffeemaker was a challenge at first as there were no directions for it.  We looked it up online and were able to figure it out.  There were no coffee mugs or hair dryer - a call to JJ set that right.  The water draining in our bathroom sink was slow and that was tweaked as well.  The shower was very good. We spent one afternoon sitting on the topside deck watching the ships in the harbor - the view was awesome. The boat was in a wonderful location to access all of Boston - within five minutes were the North End, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, the aquarium, Rowes Wharf and all the ferries, whale watching boats and cruise boats. I wouldn't hesitate to rent from SleepAfloat again.  In fact, I'm looking forward to it.\n",
            "\n",
            "- We stayed 2 nights on Capricornus for Colombus Day. Our 2 children (10 and 13 years old) enjoyed this experience and their parents as well! The houseboat is well located and in great condition!\n",
            "- Great location, very friendly community and super convenient from the airport. Golden Goose market is right across the street, as is the tour bus depot. Would go back again next year!\n",
            "- A unique place to stay. The Capricornus had all the amenities of a hotel room. Would definitely stay again.\n",
            "- Bateau très confortable et bien placé en plein centre ville. Le personnel d'administration disponible et efficace.\n",
            "Nous avons passé un très bon moment à Boston.\n",
            "- We stayed on Capricornicus houseboat during a business trip to Boston and had a great experience.  The location was very convenient and we had everything we needed for our stay.\n",
            "- I recommend it to anyone ! It's such a cool experience and very comfortable to sleep on a boat. We used the BBQ and had breakfast on the roof of the boat. The location is great and it was clean. Id go back there next time I go to Boston.\n",
            "- The location and atmosphere was great. As we had no car, we caught a water taxi from Logan Airport to Sargeants Wharf (which is adjacent to Lewis Wharf). Lewis Wharf, and our boat, Capricornia, was only a short walk to the Freedom Trail, Hanover Street Restaurants and Boston Common.\n",
            "Our boat was very clean, and we were pleasantly surprised with the size and spaciousness of the boat. \n",
            "- We absolutely loved our stay on the boat and would choose it over a hotel anytime. It was clean, well equipped and more spacious than we expected. The beds were comfortable and we all slept really well. It was cosy inside and we loved the top deck too. The marina felt safe and it felt quite special staying there. It was also much closer than we thought to Quincy Market etc. John who met us was a great guy and so helpful. We really recommend this place to stay and hope to return one day.\n",
            "- We had a fantastic time on this house boat. Ther are 2 bedrooms and 1 pullout couch in living room. Boat sleeps up to 6 people pretty comfortably. Full bathroom and full shower. They are linked inside by sliding door so someone can use the bathroom while someone showers. Nice touch. Very clean. Huge couch with 2 arm chairs. Nice full kitchen. Definitely better than we expected. We will definitely be back this summer. \n",
            "- Great place to spend time in Boston!  Close to many north end attractions.  Boat was clean and quite roomy.  Will come back if i'm ever returning to Boston.\n",
            "- We came late on a Saturday night and let ourselves in.  The instructions were excellent and we had no problems.  The accommodation is very good and the location is next to everything in the old part of Boston (the North End).\n",
            "\n",
            "Bob was very responsive when we needed an extra towel and a lightbulb changed.  Having a living room and kitchen to come back to was really fun for the whole family and sure beats getting a couple of hotel rooms!\n",
            "- Very accommodating host who let us check in early.  Very comfortable boat in a convenient position for all the key sites of Boston \n",
            "- Had a wonderful time on the Capricornus! The space was much larger than expected, very clean, and well appointed.  The location was excellent, right next to Little Italy and super quiet.  David was an excellent host, responding to all of our questions promptly and giving us a helpful tour when we arrived.  Highly recommend! \n",
            "- We loved staying on the house boat.  It was exactly as described and pictured.  Clean, comfortable, and fabulous location.  Perfect accommodations for our family of 5.  Just a few minutes walk to the Aquarium, North End, USS Constitution (well this is a little more than a few minutes but definitely walkable,) the T, and all sorts of Boston tours.  Our host was kind, helpful, respectful, and generous.  He directed us to a fabulous Italian market, just a few minutes walk from the boat, and we dined on delicious mouthwatering fresh pasta al fresco on the top deck of the boat each night.   This is where we plan to stay on all future trips to Boston.  \n",
            "- This is a great place to stay. We were really pleased we chose this instead of a hotel. The boat is clean, comfortable and has loads of space, in a great location. We would recommend to anyone.\n",
            "- This was a great place to stay and relax. It had what we needed and was very convenient.\n",
            "- I had a great visit to Boston.  The apartment is newly renovated in a quiet, pretty residential area.  Owner and family live in building.  Owner, Alex, is friendly and helpful.  T Orange Line stop: Roxbury Crossing is close by and takes you into the center of the city in a few stops.  Very easy ride.  \n",
            "- Perfect place to explore Boston on a budget!  This place was beautifully adorned, luxurious and parking was a breeze.  Alex was the perfect host for me- made it easy to get in, relax and enjoy the weekend- would stay there anytime I go to Boston again.\n",
            "- Alex was very accomodating and easy to get a hold of. The place has recently been renovated and everything was clean and tidy. The place was spacious and was a please to surprise. The place was located near a T line so getting in and out of the city was easy. I would thoroughly recommend this place to others. Thanks.\n",
            "- Alex did a great job of getting us settled in with no hassle. Access to the place was simple and it was very well maintained. He has done a great job renovating and restoring the house and it certainly shows, he did it with good taste. No IKEA stuff anywhere! It is well worth the stay if you appreciate quality. Close proximity to the T made getting in and out of the city very simple and straight forward.\n",
            "- Enjoyed our stay very much! Alex's place is both comfortable and conveniently located to the T and  the Hub Way Bike shares. It was also a short walk to the Northeastern campus, which was a daily destination for us. Alex has his place tastefully decorated and all amenities that we needed. Alex was also available to answer questions and give us insight into the area. We will stay again, in the future.\n",
            "- I had a great experience at Alex long's apt. He was a great host! The apartment was very nice , beautiful kitchen and comfy couch with tv amd wireless. It was well furnished with everything you need. The jacuzzi tub was relaxing and the bed was very comfortable! \n",
            "The only drawback was its in Roxbury which is not the greatest of areas. It's quite a walk to the store! There is a t station not too far away, but not close enough when weather is bad! I took taxis the whole time!\n",
            "It is about 3 miles from downtown! I was so happy I had a kitchen and not a hotel room!\n",
            "- Great place! Beautiful remodeled and decorated. Great appliances, well stocked kitchen. (And Whole Foods isn't too far away!) Close to all the places in Boston we wanted to go. Easy access to the T, but lots of parking on the street for a rental car as well. Why go with an expensive Boston hotel when you can have all this? Alex was the perfect blend of attentive and respectful. Will definitely come back the next time we are in Boston.\n",
            "- The home was a beautiful place and the new renovations look amazing. It provided easy access the T and a short ride into the heart of the city. There was plenty of on street parking for the times we needed to drive. \n",

            "\n",
            "- My stay here was awesome! Alex was super accommodating and I have no complaints whatsoever.  In the pictures the apartment looked great but it's even better in person! Next time I'm in Boston I will be staying here definitely.\n",
            "- Alex was a great host.  His unit is beautiful and located nearby the Convention Center, which made for easy commute each day.  \n",
            "- Alex was very accommodating and honest. There was a minor issue that he gave me advanced warning on. He was super helpful and understanding when I had a car issue when I was supposed to checkout.\n",
            "- Very nice space in a comfortable neighborhood that has flavor (isn't the sterile, generic environment found around hotel chains)\n",
            "\n",
            "Very accommodating and easy to communicate with.\n",
            "- The apartment was beautiful and clean with wonderful amenities. Prefect area to explore Boston. Alex was a gracious and extremely helpful host and we would love to stay here again! \n",
            "- This place is phenomenal. Spacious, 2 stories, everything is brand new. When compared to a hotel, well, I cannot understand why anyone would stay in a hotel. Alex' rental is more than $100 less, when including hotel's exorbitant taxes and parking charge. Great communication from Alex. We stayed for 2 days and had no issues. Met Alex and his feisty puppy when we were checking out. I would most definitely stay here again if I want to be in this area of Boston.\n",
            "- We enjoyed the apartment; it was clean and comfortable. Not ideal for young kids (steep staircase without a handrail) but not terrible. Alex was a helpful host, and we especially appreciate his help coordinating our stay with another AirBnB host for a night when his place was booked.\n",
            "- We loved staying at Alex's apartment during our trip to Boston. The apartment was better than in pictures and exactly what we were looking for - quiet, comfortable, clean and spacious. It was so nice to have a fully equipped kitchen and we loved that the bedroom and bathroom were separate from the living area - a rarity in Boston! \n",
            "Alex was quick to respond to any questions we had and made us feel very welcome in his home. We loved the neighbourhood and free parking was a bonus. \n",
            "We will definately stay with Alex and his family when we are back in Boston.\n",
            "Thanks for being such a gracious host!!\n",
            "- Alex's place was just as described by both Alex and many reviewers - clean, spacious and recently modernized. Very short walk to the T which was only about a 20-min ride into downtown (or 5 min over to Sam Adams Brewery in the other direction). We very much enjoyed the stay and will definitely stay again the next time we return. Alex was a great host too - stopped by to make sure everything was going well. We even took him up on buying his pair of tickets for one night at Fenway - AMAZING seats (do it if you have the chance). Would definitely recommend staying here!\n",
            "- The apartment Alex is incredible. It looks much better than in the picture with luxury amenities that make this place a very nice place to stay in Boston. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Location is very convenient both for parking and public transportation.\n",
            "- Alex is just lovely and the space is very nice - a little bit construction zone but otherwise very nice.  Very quiet and restful.  The neighborhood is fine - nothing really close to eat so bring it in or be prepared to walk, T, or drive.  The back porch is wonderful!\n",
            "- Alex provides a code to enter the dwelling so it's VERY convenient. Also, it's located less than a 1/2 mile from public transportation which is great!  The bedroom is almost subterranean so it's really quiet.  The apartment is really spacious and well appointed. It's down a quiet alley so not a lot of traffic noise, etc. \n",
            "- Amazing place, we had a great time in Boston. Alex was a really good host. The apt. is close to the public transport in an quiet neighborhood.\n",
            "- Stayed at Alex's place in May 2015. Just as described in the listing. It was new, modern and very comfortable. Master bedroom in the basement also gave some privacy from the kids :) The space was fairly large and comfortable for a family of four. Parking was on the street but ample parking which was a big plus. I understand that the area is not the best if you speak to Boston folks but we thought the area was just fine - a short drive to anywhere in Boston. There was perhaps an issue that there were no eating places/grocery stores we could see within walking distance but since we had a rental, that was not an issue at all. \n",
            "Overall, great stay. Alex was always available to help but we since everything was well set up, we didn't need any help !!\n",
            "- Very nice place, easy to get there, close to everything... I highly recommend it ! \n",
            "Très jolie endroit, facile d'accès, près de tout... Je recommande vraiment ! \n",
            "- Alex was incredibly nice and very accommodating. The place was perfect for what we needed- a home base around Jamaica Plain to visit with family and friends. There was plenty of space to cook. The bedroom downstairs was a great set-up: we put our toddler to bed and were able to invite a few guests over for dinner.  It's a 5 minute walk to the orange line and was ideal for getting downtown or to Jamaica Plain. \n",
            "- El departamento es tal como lo anunciado y Alex fue muy amable con nosotros. \n",
            "Si uno no anda en automovil, el barrio no es muy bueno.\n",
            "- Great place for a weekend stay, especially if you go to Boston by car. Free and safe parking on the street and only a few minutes walk to the subway. Only three stops from Back Bay and five from downtown. \n",
            "Clean and neat apartment where we easily did some cooking. It all looks much better than the pictures.\n",
            "Comfortable bed for two downstairs next to the bathroom. On the ground floor an open space with kitchen, dining table for four and an armchair and a sofabed (not all that comfortable to sleep in for an adult) by the TV. And a porch to step out to in the back.\n",
            "Alex is easy to get in touch with and really helpful. I am not used to garbage disposals but Alex took care of the mess I made with that... Thanks!\n",
            "- Alex was a great host. The place was clean and very comfortable. The location is excellent, a short walk from the T and two stops away from the Sam Adams Brewery. Would definitely stay there again. \n",
            "- A terrific spot close-in to Fenway, Back Bay, and more. Enjoyed the comfort and convenience, as well as the distinctive design and neighborhood. Parking was easy as promised, which is very helpful when you are driving in an unfamiliar place.  And all at a reasonable price, especially for Greater Boston.\n",
            "- Superlative accommodation, host and location. The quiet little dead-end street is like a little Shangri-la in the heart of Boston. (Really enjoyed relaxing on the back deck in the swing chair!) Easy access to Roxbury Stop on the T & a nice stroll on walking path to NEU. I'll be back Alex! Thank you!   \n",
            "- Alex was attentive and responded quickly to all questions and concerns, before and during our stay. The apartment is beautiful, clean and in a great location. \n",
            "- Overall great stay. The room was exactly as described. A little bit if a scare about the parking situation but got resolved. The wifi never did work during our whole stay though.\n",
            "- l'accueil avec Alex, c'est plutôt bien passé, tout était décrit dans l'annonce. nous avons trouvé facilement. il faut savoir que c'est un quartier résidentiel avec peu de choses autour, mais il y a un metro à 7 min a pieds qui vous emmène dans le centre. L'appartement est agréable à vivre mais un peu sombre, j'ai fait aussi remarqué a Alex que la chambre était un peu humide, je lui souhaite de résoudre le problème. mis a part cela nous étions très bien dans son appartement.\n",
            "- Alex was very responsive to our communications. He was helpful on the phone when our Uber driver had a little trouble finding the place. (The driver didn't have the zip code). The apartment was as described. Recently remodeled and very well done. Very close to the subway. Very easy and comfortable. A great way to see Boston.\n",
            "- Alex has created a wonderful opportunity for Airbnb guests.  The reservation process was quick and easy.  Alex met me on arrival.  We talked for several minutes ... like reacquainting with an ole friend.  Great guy and family!  Then, we toured the apartment.  It is new remodeled, beautifully furnished, and looks as pictured or better.   He deserves to be proud of his design and recent handiwork.  The first floor is an open concept space with a comfortable living room, full kitchen with stainless appliances and granite counter-tops, and a full-size dining table.  The large bedroom and bathroom are downstairs.  The bed and linens are very comfortable and tastefully selected.   The room has ample closet and dresser space for extended stays. The bath is nicely tiled with a combination jetted tub /shower and modern granite vanity.  The apartment is very private, but it was comforting to know that Alex and his family were nearby if needed.  They live on the upper floors of this Boston Brownstone.  Conveniently, this home is a five minute walk from a T station and within a few stops / 20 minutes of the Freedom Trail.   Truly, a lucky find!\n",
            "- Alex is a very nice and friendly person. He made sure our stay was comfortable and the apartment is very well maintained and a perfect place to live in Boston in that budget. Convenient parking on the street made my stay all the more easy. \n",
            "- Sono stata per 5 giorni a casa di Alex in agosto insieme a mio marito e mio figlio diciassettenne. La casa è molto spaziosa, soprattutto la zona giorno è molto bella con una grande cucina ben attrezzata che si affaccia su una veranda immersa nel verde. La zona è molto silenziosa e si dorme bene. Noi avevamo un'auto a noleggio che è stata molto comoda per raggiungere il centro e i negozi, anche se non indispensabile. Alex è stato molto gentile nel rispondere a tutte le mie domande a darmi suggerimenti sulle cose da fare in zona. Consiglio a tutti questa casa, la prossima volta che sarò a Boston ci tornerò sicuramente.\n",
            "- Our stay was very enjoyable.  The apartment was really nice and we only wished we could of stayed longer.  We walked everywhere we wanted to go and it was really easy to get around.  Alex was helpful and responded to all of my requests quickly.  I would definitely recommend this place. \n",
            "- This home was very comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. My family felt right at home with the lovely kitchen and cozy living area, as well as a bedroom on a separate floor, which made for nice privacy with 4 adults. The home felt updated and luxurious inside with stylish finishes. Alex was very friendly and communicative before and after our stay. Although we didn't have any issues while we were there, it was good to know that in case we needed anything, he was accessible and lived inside the building. Definitely recommended!\n",
            "- We rented this apartment in September. Alex was very nice to let us check in earlier, since nobody was staying there the day before. We really appreciate it. \n",
            "Apartment is recently renovated. In fact, there's still  some ongoing constraction projects. Kitchen is very modern with granite counters, big dining table and plenty of storage. It has cozy living space and relaxing back porch. \n",
            "Bathroom and bedroom are downstairs in the basement. Although both of them are newly done, it's very humid there and has some musty smell. Also bathtub is very deep and if you are not a tall person or have some back issues it's quite challenging to get in and out. Speaking of bathroom, it would be good if there was some kind of hook on the bathroom door to hang your robe or other clothes.\n",
            "We were in Alex's apartment for 5 nights and since as I mentioned earlier it's very humid in the bathroom, towels stayed a bit damp constantly. So, I wish there was a dryer or we could get towels replacement at least once.\n",
            "Alex's place is located at the end of the quiet street in Roxbury area of Boston. It's about 6 blocks from Roxbury crossing T station. It's very easy to get in and out of the  city.\n",
            "- Alex was great with answering all of our questions before our trip! We loved the apartment! It was perfect for a weekend away for four! Such a great location! Can't wait to come back! \n",
            "- We stayed at Alex ' s charming two level boston home and it was perfectly convenient to move around from as the orange line station Roxbury crossing is closeby. Alex is a wonderful helpful guy who saved us from missing our connection when the Boston cab didn't send a cab as ordered though we had reserved one the night before. All in all we had a real good time and would go back anytime. Thanks Alex.\n",
            "P.S. He was very good about our early arrival. Pulled a rabbit out of his hat. \n",
            "- Perfect apartment for a weekend getaway, a home away from home. Alex was very helpful and available for any issues that came up. \n",

            "Next time in Boston would definitely stay with Alex\n",
            "- What a find!!   Alex, your apartment is flawless.   You have an amazing taste in design.   We could not have asked for more in our home away from home.    Even for a senior, the trip to the train station was just a short walk away.   We greatly appreciated your availability when we had questions.  Thanks so much for accommodating this Seattle couple.\n",
            "- My boyfriend and I stayed with Alex for 4 nights. The place was clean and beautifully updated. It was really easy to get around the city from this place.\n",
            "- Meine Frau und ich hatten eine sehr schöne Zeit in der Wohnung. Sie war groß, sehr sauber und bestens eingerichtet. Auch Besuch konnte empfangen werden. Alles funktionierte gut. Das Schlafzimmer im Untergeschoss war zweckmäßig und das Bett sehr bequem, lediglich die Heizung bzw. Klimaanlage störte etwas. Die Wohnung befindet sich in einer ruhigen Sackgasse, trotzdem ist man mit der TUBE rasch im Geschehen. Über die durch Codes gesicherten Eingangstüren konnte man selbständig die Wohnung betreten, sodass wir anfangs keinen Kontakt zu Alex hatten. Später konnten wir ihn jedoch als Gastgeber kennen lernen, der sich sicherlich auch bei Fragen um Antworten kümmern würde; wir hatten aber keine Fragen. Wenn wir mal wieder nach Boston kommen, werden wir gerne erneut bei Alex wohnen.\n",
            "- I was in Boston for a conference and stayed there for 3 nights, sharing with a colleague. It was close to the subway and reasonably quiet. Good value for money compared to hotels (which are ridiculously expensive in Boston). The flat is not very bright but that was not an issue for me.\n",
            "- Alex's place was perfect, finding it was a little difficult but once I found the place and got inside I had no words. The apartment was stunning. The area was fairly quiet, either that or the apartment was isolated enough to drown out any noise from outside! I loved the feeling of being there, Alex was a great host, he even told me about 2 apps I've never even heard of before! I feel so in with technology now! The first snow of the season also arrived during my stay, which I gladly faced as I've never been in Boston when it snowed! The purpose of my trip ended well, and I'm so glad Alex was so accommodating and patient with my cluelessness! We even spoke of a potential extra night of me staying should the weather become severe, and he also called me at night to make sure I made it home safe, I've never had a more pleasant host than Alex, honestly. He's the best! I would 100% use his place again\n",
            "- When you are searching for a place to call home for a stay in Boston you cannot go wrong with Alex's home. Everything is picture perfect. The home is centrally located and we found it very easy to find our way around... despite it being our first time in Boston. Alex was so easy to work with and was excellent at responding to any and all questions that I had. I look forward to a return trip to Boston and my next stay in the lovely home. \n",

            "- Alex was very helpful with all the questions I had.  The apartment was very nice and clean just as described in the post. Although the location is very convenient, only two short blocks from the subway, the neighborhood wasn't the best.  However it's not the worst neighborhood either, as long as you're street smart, you should be fine. There was a binder full of things to do with maps and directions in the apartment that we found very helpful.\n",
            "The post says free parking on site however it's street parking with a two hour limit.\n",
            "- I enjoyed my stay at Alex's place. Cozy and centrally located with easy access to restaurants and coffee shops. Recommend for business travelers.\n",
            "- We had decided to try AirBNB this time because a hotel stay would be too much for when we were in town for our sons open heart surgery. We couldn't have asked for a better host. Alex was amazing. We were there over Easter and Alex even went out of his way and got our son something!  The house was perfect. A few minute drive from Boston Children's and the neighborhood is great. The location keeps you just outside of all the Boston traffic. We highly recommend using Alex and we will from here on out. \n",
            "- The house was great and it's exactly how it was pictured. I would recommend researching the neighborhood if you're not from a large city or have experience with them. The house is in a perfect location. We used uber the whole trip and it only cost from $6-$12 dollars each time. As for Alex, he was the best Airbnb host I've had so far. He is extremely accommodating and helpful. \n",

The North End is right on the Orange line, where there are a ton of historic sites & food. I thought we'd need to Uber back at night but we didn't; the T is very safe, as is Alex's neighborhood. (To put that statement in context -- I grew up in a small farming community, still live in a small town, and pretty much suspect that everyone in and city is out to get my purse if not my life). \n",

            "- My husband and I loved everything about this place. It's in a very quiet, nice looking neighborhood, just far enough away from the city for some quiet, but only a 4 minute walk to the Orange Line to get where we needed to go. The place is beautiful, and the pictures show exactly what you're getting. We were so tired walking around Boston all day, and being able to come home and cook a meal in that amazing kitchen saved us some money and sanity. Oh, and that Jacuzzi. Such a godsend after walking all day in the cold Boston rain. Bed is super comfy. Alex gave us plenty of privacy and we much appreciated that, but it was still reachable via phone. I would book this place again in a heartbeat if I ever found myself in Boston again.\n",
            "- This is a very cute, quiet place to stay. Alex was a gracious host. If you need absolute dark to sleep, bring an eye mask because the downstairs bedroom isn't super dark. There's nice wispy curtains though, so it is very private. It's somewhat damp downstairs, but the bathroom is lovely!\n",
            "- The apt was just as pictured and easy to find. It was even more spacious than I thought it was going to be. The back patio was nice for enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning. It was also super convenient having free parking nearby. Definitely recommend staying here if you're going to be checking out Boston. \n",
            "- The house was just at looks in the pictures, very well put together and comfortable! We really appreciated the fact that it was so close to the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and the Prudential Center (where the duck tours departs from). The host made sure we were comfortable and was very easy to reach. Thank you for making our trip to Boston that much better!\n",
            "- Great experience! Three of us were there for a conference. This place was exactly what we needed. The location was very close to the train station so the commute was easy. There are also plenty street parking around the area. The apartment itself was clean, spacious, and well decorated; so we all got to relax well. \n",

            "\n",
            "The unit is most certainly not well represented by the photos -- as is the case with many images on ABNB, they just don't do the place justice!  The unit is spacious and well decorated, with a well-apportioned kitchen, should you want to get your Gordon Ramsay on.  The bedroom is tucked away downstairs and is quiet.  If you're looking to get some good sleep with a minimum of the typical distraction of a city (cars, subways, etc.) you will get that here.\n",
            "\n",
            "The location is (as everyone says) within short 15m walk to the Longwood/HMS area -- just don't forget your umbrella as I did and suffer a late night rain shower.  The subway is less than a 6 minute walk and you can easily connect to the commuter line should you need to get a little further out into the adjacent communities without  a car.  If you're looking for a late night coffee or tea, try JP Licks -- a straight shot toward HMS.  There are other restaurants and bars, but in general the area is pretty quiet and low key after dark.\n",

            "- This was a phantastic stay. Alex gave very good information in advance. The house is 5 min walk from Roxbury Crossing therefore an easy ride with the T wherever u want to go in Boston. The house in 2 levels is very well designed. Modern kitchen with anything u need to cook. The place is much better than its photographs. The bedroom was in the basement with the bathroom and they are both really nice. We met Alex the last day. He is really friendly and knows what he is doing with his business. Fully recommend for a nice stay short or long in Boston.\n",
            "- First Airbnb experience and it was terrific.  The place was great and the host attentive but not intrusive.  We would definitely come back. Boston is lovely, the street is lovely and the house was just right.  We cooked a few meals and spent some nice time on the back porch with coffee in the morning. Highly recommend this flat! \n",
            "- I'll just start off by saying that this place is amazing!...and now I'll tell you why. Alex is such a nice person, he made sure that we were settling in well and asked us if we needed anything, but other than that left us to our own adventure (which we didn't mind at all.) The apartment is gorgeous! I could go on and on about the kitchen for days. It looks just like the photos. I was so happy that we were able to have a few dinners in while we were on our trip. I was told when we got there that we weren't in the best of neighborhoods...but we didn't have any problems. Everyone we ran into on the street was nice, and I can honestly say I didn't ever feel like I was in danger. My friend even felt comfortable biking around at night. The place is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest T (URL HIDDEN) prepared for hills. There is wi-fi and cable, we did have an issue with the wi-fi our first night but I also have comcast and understand how annoying it can be...and as soon as we talked to Alex about it the next morning, he fixed it. I would just like to warn anyone that it is a split level... It's obvious when you look back at the pictures, but I just didn't think about it until we got there. So be aware that the bedroom and bathroom are downstairs (below the ground level floor). If you can manage stairs, this is the place for you! We've already recommended it to family, and if we return to Boston we hope that this place will be open!\n",
            "- Alex was a very gracious host. Although we were able to get in on our own when we arrived, he met us and gave us some tips on getting around. He checked in on us a couple of times (he lives nearby), and fixed the cable on the tv. The space was just lovely, completely decked out with all you could need. The neighborhood was eclectic, filled with beautiful old homes and very near public transportation. \n",

It has a lovely little deck off the kitchen where we sat and had our morning coffee from the nearby Dunkin' Donuts each morning.  Our son also lives in Roxbury where he attends Northeastern University, and because Boston is so small and accessible, it was easy to get around either walking, on the T, or using an Uber.  We will definitely stay there again when we visit Boston!  Thanks, Alex!\n",
            "- Fantastic place! Just beautiful, and we loved the outdoor deck in the am for coffee/tea. Very comfortable bed and bedroom. Wonderful air-conditioning, which is great in the summer. Can't think of a thing to change. Keep up the good work!!\n",
            "- Alex was very helpful, during both the planning stage and the trip itself. The apartment was true to the listing and even better than expected. I wish we had more time to cook meals in the beautiful kitchen, and one of my favorite parts of the apartment is the hanging chair in the backyard. Location is comfortable for walking, taking the T, or getting an Uber. Great trip, would go back in a heartbeat and recommend to all.\n",
            "- This was the best Airbnb experience I've ever had! The easiest check in. The space was gorgeous and HUGE for two people. Everything was really clean and up to date. Loved the fully stocked kitchen and was able to cook breakfast in the mornings. The balcony was really nice to sit and relax after a long day. The bed was so comfy. The neighborhood isn't very central and not inconvenient either. We were able to get the subway or a $10 uber to most places. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!\n",

Alex was friendly & very accessible without being intrusive at all. neighborhood was quiet & deck was awesome to have! everything we could have possibly needed was there & everything was clean & comfortable. overall great experience!\n",
            "- the info you need for Alex's place is provided and easy to access.  we had a couple questions when we.first got there and Alex was quick to respond.  the place was clean and the bed very comfortable! easy walk to the the t.  definitely would stay again!\n",
            "- Alex was a great host and accomodating, we had an early flight and were able to check in early which was really helpful because we were traveling with a toddler. The apartment is comfortable and has great finishes. There are two levels on the first floor is the living room, kitchen, and dining room and the bathroom and bedroom are down stairs. It is centrally located, we didn't use public transportation this trip but the bus is two blocks away. Which is great because parking in Back Bay, Faneuil Hall and tourist areas is expensive and difficult.\n",
            "- Nicholas was VERY accommodating and helpful. It was out first experience with airbnb and he made it a fabulous one. Loft was exactly as described and more. Perfect location around the corner from T. Neighborhood was near everything and within walking distance to lots of restaraunts and historical places. We would definitely stay here again. Easily accessible with our luggage and private elevator made us feel safe. Ten minutes from airport was a plus. Has to be one of the best places in Boston to stay, hands down!!\n",
            "- We really had a wonderful stay with Keith and Beth. Although they weren't there when we arrived, we felt at home from the very beginning. The rooms are very spacious, as is the house. Everything you need for an enjoyable stay is right there: wonderful beds (especially the one in the larger bedroom), nice and fully equiped kitchen, washing machine etc. Public transportation to downtown Boston is really close. Bus 34 brings you to the oranje line (downtown Boston). We left with happy memories and we would highly recommend staying with them! Thanks for having us!\n",

The house was beautiful and Keith and Beth were both very welcoming and friendly. We were sad our roadtrip only allowed us to stay one night there! A must-go if you have a car (the house is 30 minutes away from downtown Boston by car).\n",

            "- For our family of five, staying in this beautiful bungalow was perfect! The rooms are clean and spacious, and Keith and Beth were welcoming and helpful. As we are with five, we were provided with an extra bed for our youngest, which worked great. We used both public transport and a (rented) car to get around; the bus stop is really quite close to the house so both options work. Keith even advised us on the best place to go for a run around the neighborhood! This bungalow was a great starting point for our trip, and we would certainly stay here again. \n",
            "- Upon entering the house, we were greeted by Keith. He showed us around the house and allowed us to settle down afterwards. The house gives off a nice rustic feel; while still being very clean and organized. The neighborhood is also very nice and quiet.\n",

            "- Don't stay here if you like to sleep. I don't expect much from Airbnb, but the ability to sleep past 5:30am is one of them. Unfortunately the room here has 3 huge windows that Dave decided were best served by completely transparent white lace whisps of fabric, as opposed to actual curtains. It's so bright once the sun rises, you can comfortably read a book without turning on any lights. As I was unable to sleep, I texted Dave at 6:30 asking if anything could be done. He offered me a cheap plastic sleep mask; clearly he'd been in this situation before but neglected to actually do anything about it. Because of lack of proper curtains I ended up getting 4 hours of sleep before my conference. Avoid. \n",
            "- Dave's home is amazing...like a fun museum with all manner of curiosities on top of dressers, shelves and even in artful corners of the floor. My stop was just overnight so I could have a quick and easy access to the airport (and it was). \n",

The room is private and locked which I appreciated. The host checked in if we needed anything which we didn't since they provided everything in the room before hand.

Only a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station, you can hop on and be in downtown Boston very quickly. Very convenient for us, as we went downtown every day. The hosts were very helpful and friendly, providing us with clear directions and reliable communication. Though we never got to meet them, they were quick to answer questions and give advice about the area and things to see and do. Would definitely recommend staying here, I know we would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thanks to Piter and Stacy for a great stay!\n",

The bed is comfortable and the neighborhood street is very quiet. There is a decent amount of places to eat on the main street as well as a Rite Aid within walking distance. I never saw the hosts as I was out early and coming back late but I never needed a reason to contact them so that was fine. If I did needed to contact them, I had their number to call. \n",

The neighbourhood had a wide choice of restaurant options of which we did take advantage.  Since driving into Boston is not recommended, we hopped the Red Line into Park Street Station from which point we were able explore much of what Boston has to offer.  Upon arrival, Stacy made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  The room itself was spacious and very comfortable.  We had a very favourable first impression of airbnb.\n",
            "- Great room and in a nice neighborhood. The home had a lockbox and a key to the room so I never met anyone which was fine. The room and bathroom were very neat and clean with clean towels in the room for you. The room was big with its own couch and tv. First Airbnb for me and it was awesome and affordable. \n",

            "- The listing was as advertised. Enjoyed the access to public transport. Street access parking is available depending on time of day. All in all would recommend to friends and family.\n",
            "- I was on a trip from Boston to NYC to Washington DC, and it is the best place I've stayed during the whole trip! It is a spacious room with bed, sofa, and TV. We came on a Sunday night, and because there's a TV, we didn't miss Game Of Throne! Bottled water is also provided in the room. Both the bedroom and restrooms were clean. We loved our stay :)\n",
            "- We had a great time in Boston and piters place was a definitely a big part. Beds were really comfortable and clean, we were provided anything we would need and really close to the metro. Would definitely stay again \n",

The room and the bathroom were clean, the bed and the couch were comfortable, and the room is conveniently located to explore the city. Would stay there again!\n",
            "- Our stay in a room at Piter's house was enjoyable.  We did not have a car, so the five-minute walk to the T was a bonus.  We did not see much of Piter, but the room was large and comfortable.  The bed was large and the internet and cable tv worked well.  The neighborhood seemed safe when we got back late at night.  He allowed us to leave our bags there early, and placed them in our room after it had been made ready.  Overall, a great stay.\n",
            "- Everything worked like we talked about it. The room was very clean and cozy and in a calm neighbourhood  just as on the photos we saw. Unfortunately we didn't see Piter during this time, but he answered very quickly  all our questions and was very obliging with the check in and check out times.\n",

            "- Piter had the apartment ready for us in the morning just to keep our bags and refresh before starting our long day of roaming the Boston city. Stacy helped us to our apartments. No hassle in accessing the apartment since we had a separate door on a different floor with a dedicated bathroom. The room was tidy and clean with all needed accessories including iron box, ironing pad, hangers, clean bath towels, water bottles and hand sanitizer.  The bath room was clean with paste, soap, body wash and shampoo. There is no dedicated parking but I was able to find a street parking and parked my car for couple of days without a problem. Overall I liked the stay for the price and would recommend this place.\n",

            "- The room was exactly as described, Piter was really easy to reach at all times: absolutely nothing to complain about!\n",
            "- Host was great, very easy to reach. Convenient to downtown - we took uber and it was great. Only issue was there was no street parking by the apt when we arrived (very crowded), so we parked around the corner and ended up getting towed (our mistake) so be careful! \n",

            "- We didn't met Piter personally. \n",
            "The room was not very big, a little too small for 5. You can find a microwave, toaster and fridge in the corridor, but there is no possibility to sit down. \n",
            "Parking in front of the door, perfect.\n",
            "Nice for one night, but not for longer. We paid 133 Euro, which I think is too much for this room.\n",
            "- Our experience here was in general good. The room was clean and big, with a great couch, tv, iron and all we needed for a 3 day stay. The apartment is about 20 mins from downtown by underground and there are a couple good places for breakfast around the neighborhood.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, we missed a private bathroom. Sharing the bathroom took time in the mornings and one night we heard someone yelling and complaining about guests and having to clean the bathroom, while slamming doors. \n",

            "We also missed a sink out of the bathroom, forks, mugs..\n",

            "- Room was clean. Really big room. Location was good. \n",
            "- We had an excellent time staying at Piter and Stacy's house.  Stacy met us at the house before check in so we could drop off our luggage and then later put it in our room.  This was a huge help to us since we did not have a car.  She gave us some tips for getting around also.  The house is conveniently located and in a safe neighborhood.  5 min walk to the train and walking distance to bars and restaurants.  The room and shared bath were also very clean(I'm picky!!)  The shower had plenty of hot water, the pressure could have been a little better, but was sufficient.  If we are ever in Boston, we would definitely stay again!\n",
            "- The room is exactly as said. It was very clean. The toilet and bathroom (one room) is shared with others. A microwave, toaster and fridge are present in the corridor, but no further tools. There is no possibility to sit down somewhere (only on bed or sofa).\n",
            "- A really home-y location, good for families and bigger groups. A bit far from everything in the city and the parking is a bit hard to find, especially later in the night, but not so bad because I still really enjoyed my stay. Overall pretty great place (:\n",
            "- Can't beat the value for this place - close to a T stop, a 15 minute drive down town, and the the bed was so comfortable! My friend stayed on the geometric couch and said it was great. Thanks for a comfortable stay!\n",
            "- We are delighted by staying at Piter's place during our vacation to Boston. The room is clean and tidy. It is located very close to subway station as described. It is very convenient for us day-in day-out. Though no kitchen facility is available (as described), the host is kind enough to provide bottle water for us to enjoy. Thank you Piter. A very enjoyable stay.\n",
            "- My family of four stayed a night in a large room with a king bed and a sofa bed. The room was on a third floor. A room and a shared bathroom were clean but a house was old. Another family guests were quite.  There was a frig and a microwave in a shared alley. Some plastic plates and plastic utensils too. But there was no kitchen nor sink. A/C was in my room and worked well in a hot summer night. Free wifi and 40 inch cable TV. Given very expensive hotels in downtown Boston, it was a very affordable stay.\n",
            "- We arrived early nighttime and because we had no internet or telephone we could not contact Piter, but luckily one of the guys renovating the house was there and he was very hospitable. The neighbourhood looks unsympathetic at first (and at night) but when morning came around it wass more than pleasant. Its about 10 minutes with car from the city but its completely bearable. The beds were very comfortable, there was enough room for four people. I was lacking a small kitchen however, but we didnt seem to mind afterall. He was always quick to reply. \n",
            "- Eileen was a nice and friendly person. She reacted promptly on emails. The neighborhood is run down, but I did not feels unsafe on the streets even late at night. \n",

            "\n",
            "If you are on a tight budget, this place will work just to sleep.\n",
            "- Vanessa was a great host! Her house was very clean and like new. She provided all the necessary utensils for us and was also kind enough to give us dumplings to eat when we were starved to death the first night we arrived.

She is easy to communicate with and since Vanessa lives one floor down, privacy issue was also not a problem at all. Overall a very comfortable stay :)\n",

Love the place a lot, will definitely stay there again if I ever go to Boston. Vanessa and her husband are very kind and they have a cute cat too.\n",
            "- Vanessa met me at the door. Her manner, friendly and personable, made me feel comfortable and at home right away.

If you are driving however, be careful of where you are parking. I saw a car getting towed and another getting the boot. They are very strict so make sure you read all the signs before you park anywhere. It was a good thing I asked Liesl about the parking or that could've been me.

Comfortable bed, a fabulous shower, and convenient washer and dryer in the lower level helped make our stay quite enjoyable.\n",
            "- Communication when first booked and right up to the minutes before we arrived was great.  Kevin gave us lots of good info on how to get around and about parking.  We got super lucky with parking because we were gone during the day, so when we came back to park, it was during the \"free\" time (after 8) for on-street parking and we kept finding spaces right near by!  The apartment was cute, cozy and as described.  The neighborhood is vibrant and fun.  We had dinner at Stephi's which is within walking distance. Saved $$ on breakfast by stopping by the small convenience store that was right nearby. This was a great place to stay in Boston, I only wish we hadn't been so busy all day and would have had more time to just enjoy hanging out at the apartment or checking out more of the area. \n",

Both Jason and his roommate were very friendly and welcoming which was comforting. The apartment was slightly cluttered and the room was small, however the rooftop view and the overall space made up for this. Also they have a very cute dog. \n",
            "- This flat is amazing and in a great location. Jason and his flatmate Jeff are great guys and made me feel welcome. They have a dog but don't let this out you off...I've never met a dog so placid and calm. The room is very small and is big enough for 2 people only. It's not a room you'll want to spend time in but was perfect for my needs. The rooftop area as well is incredible.\n",
            "- Mohsen was away for our trip but he was an excellent host, very easy to contact and answered all our questions quickly. He also set up a YouTube video making arrival very easy.

There was always room on the street to park (but I did tend to return with my car before 7:30 in the evening). There is a stop on the red line not too far away, which was very convenient for getting to Cambridge and downtown Boston. If you can climb stairs without any problem, I highly recommend this host.  You *must* be able to climb stairs to stay here! \n",

The kitchen was stocked with breakfast fixings, including eggs, bacon, yogurt, and granola, and there were drinks and snacks as well. Even, much to my delight, chocolate! \n",
            "The room was lovely with plenty of storage and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spacious, bright and pretty and stocked just as well as the kitchen. There was a hairdryer, linens and all the toiletries you can imagine. If you forgot something, they had it.\n",
            "The Richters thought of everything.\n",
            "The house itself is delightful with all the charm that comes with an old well-loved home. I would stay here again in a flash, and hope to do just that next year. \n",
            "This was my first Airbnb experience and if they're all this wonderful I'll never stay in another hotel. \n",
            "- Polly was absolutely amazing. She was quick to respond with any questions we may of had. She was able to direct us toward great restaurants! House expectations were superb along with the wonderful blueberry muffins she made, for breakfast, before we were on our way! Super host is an understatement! Thanks Polly! \n",
            "- A nice room with a friendly host and good transit access. Polly was very helpful with our late night arrival (near midnight) and gave good directions. The room was nicely done, and coffee (and often muffins!) were in the kitchen each day.\n",
            "\n",
            "I was somewhat worried about the location, but both the Shawmut and Ashmont stations of the Red Line were really quite close--pro tip--if you're going to Ashmont station, take St Mark's to Dorchester Ave and then go left--it will be mostly flat and avoid the hill that Adams to Ashmont has.\n",
            "- I use AirBNB all of the time and this is always may favorite of them all. Polly is the most accommodating host and makes one feel at home in her house. The home is an 18 century mansion with tons of history. The furniture is very comfortable and the 6ft bathtub is super comfortable after a day of seeing the sights of Boston. There is a T station about a 5 minute walk away that will take you anywhere in the city. I highly recommend. \n",
            "- Polly was an awesome host! From start to finish our trip was perfect. From the freshly made muffins and coffee in a morning to the beautiful room and porch and excellent location. Both my twin sister and I couldn't fault it! I highly recommend anyone to stay with Polly. It was our first ever Air BnB experience and it was one to remember. Thank you Polly!\n",
            "- We had a very comfortable stay here and it was a neat opportunity to be in such an old, historic feeling home! Very creaky floors to boot. Our room and the shared bathroom were spacious and clean. We loved sitting on the big front porch, both in the morning and late at night. If you like Vietnamese food, this is the neighborhood for you! I really appreciated the breakfast snacks that were available in the kitchen, it made us feel at home and our mornings a lot simpler to have that taken care of. Best granola I've ever eaten! Also, Polly was sweet enough to provide us with a bottle of champagne in our room!\n",
            "- The bed was the best part of my stay by far--huge, I think King-sized, and one of those compression mattresses. I slept so well. Unfortunately the rest of the space wasn't so great. It was more like crashing with friends (for free) in their spare room  than staying at an Airbnb. The room was weirdly decorated and there was a huge TV but I couldn't figure out how to watch anything on it. The bathroom wasn't foul, but needed a clean (stubble in the sink both days I was there). Michael was very available and responded to messages, and for that reason and for the amazing bed and the privacy of the room I give a three-star review, otherwise it's more of a 2, relative to other places I've stayed. Finally, I'll confirm that the room is close to a T stop, 5-10 minutes. It's also close to good restaurants, bars and a pharmacy.\n",
            "- Michael was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. His apartment is in a very convenient location on the green line. Very enjoyable experience. \n",
            "- Michael's place was perfect for crashing in Boston. Whilst I never met Michael himself, he was amazing at responding quickly to any enquiries and provided excellent recommendations for places to eat. The room was very handy for Green Line T (Brigham Circle stop was like a 4min walk) and a great base to explore beautiful Boston. Like the other reviewer said, it's not a glamourous or glitzy place but the bed was very comfy and all I needed was a reasonably priced place to crash during my 3 nights in Boston and this met that criteria perfectly.\n",
            "- Michael was extremely nice! From picking me up at the airport to being easy to contact at all times, he was overall a great host! He really helped make my move to Boston go smoothly! \n",
            "- Everything was as advertised. Brent was very helpful and was able to sort us out with a room. (after we tried to book one of his other properties) Location was brilliant and place was really modern and clean. We had no problems at all and would stay again. \n",
            "- Brent was very easy to communicate with and accommodated my special request because I was in quite a bind. I am grateful for that. \n",
            "My son and his friend stayed here, both 18 and thought it was great. \n",
            "- The apartment is simply amazing, a real 5 stars experience. Check in and checkout was very smooth with no problem. Kara was very helpful and responsive, would love to stay here again\n",
            "- We had a great stay at this comfortabele appartment. The location is really perfect! So close to all fun things to do; the park, shops, site seeing and restaurants.\n",
            "The Place is very kids friendly, there is a great kitchen and 2 bathrooms which make it a great Place to see with friends as well, even though there is 1 bed room. We slept in the kids room On area bed, and slept very well!\n",
            "I can truly advice this Place for a great wknd in a great city!\n",
            "- My husband and I with our 4 daughters had a wonderful stay in Boston at Leslie's apartment.  It was the perfect place for us to relax and it was an amazing neighborhood.  We love Italian food so to stay in the North End couldn't have been better.  Leslie had some great restaurant recommendations as well.  Thank you, Leslie, for sharing your apartment with us\n",
            "- We had a great stay. The appartment is very confortable very well located, within walking distance of all visits we made during our 3 days in Boston. The appartment is children friendly, which we greatly appreciated since we travalled with our 3 children (6 month, 4 and 6 years old). We recommend this appartment if you are having a few days in Boston.\n",
            "- Leslie was extremely helpful with everything.  The apartment is perfectly located in the north end near everything you could need and very clean.  I will be staying here again in the future.\n",
            "- Beautiful place! Leslie was very accommodating through the whole process. Perfect location and enough space for all. Would stay again.\n",
            "- Great location!  Lots of space.  Easy walk around downtown Boston and easy access to public transportation.  Wonderful spot for families with kids.  \n",
            "- Spent a long holiday weekend here on a girls' trip and had a great time!  Leslie's house is lovely and she was immediately responsive when we had a question.  The location can't be beat as it's central to so many great sights and restaurants within walking distance.\n",
            "- House was great and Loved the Neighborhood.  Unfortunately, we were in Boston for just a couple days.  Very close to everything for anyone wanting to go to Boston and visit.  No need for a car.  We did use Uber, for first time, to get from the house to the airport.  Only cost $14 and arrived very quickly.\n",
            "- Incredible.  From beginning to end. Very prompt service, informative, and great apt. This was my first time using and will 100% use again. Thank you.\n",
            "- The whole experience was excellent in all aspects. Easy move in and easy move out with very good instructions for both. The building is outstanding, the 24hr concierge were really helpful and polite. The apatment was great in all aspects. The Gym was great. Location could  not be better.\n",
            "The only thing  was T Mobile had no reception inside the building, so I could not use  my mobile phone while i was inside the apartment\n",
            "- Baljinder & Sandra did a great job at communicating with me, prior to my stay.  Their home was quaint.  Their place is close to the airport and made my commute for my morning flight easy.\n",
            "- Our stay at Baljinder and Sarah's apartment was great. The apartment is bare but very clean. They kindly provided shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothpaste, and floss. They also provided fresh towels for us everyday! Although we were unfamiliar with this neighborhood, we felt very safe, and getting to Boston was very easy and quick -- ~8 minute walk to the Blue line train station, and then ~10 min train ride into downtown Boston. Similarly, it was about a 10 min Uber ride into the city. \n",
            "\n",
            "The only downside of our stay was that the AC was not working, and this past weekend was very hot. Other than that, we had a very enjoyable stay here. We never met Baljinder or Sarah but they texted to ask if we needed anything, and we felt very taken care of. Overall great experience and would recommend for anyone looking for a no frills and pleasant weekend stay in Boston. \n",
            "- Good apartment at east Boston. The apartment simple and clean. We felt safe at the neighborhood. The AC is not working, but  having fan. The transport is convenient to Quincy market and downtown.\n",
            "- Baljinder fue un excelente anfitrión, siempre dispuesto a resolver las inquietudes que se nos presentaran. El aprtamento estaba muy limpio y organizado y la ubicación de éste muy buena, pues contabamos con una estación de meto cerca.\n",
            "El barrio muy bonito y tranquilo, las personas muy amables.\n",
            "- Place was clean, location is ok. \n",
            "Communication was excellent. Host always responded very fast, and helpful way.\n",
            "Location very close to airport, which was very convenient for our trip.\n",
            "Keep in mind it is a first floor.\n",
            "- The apartment was clean and perfect for an overnight stay in boston. The bathroom was pretty small and didn't have great lighting, but other than that no complaints! I would stay here again\n",
            "- The apartment is very cozy and nice. It has the Boston feel I was looking for. The location is great, you get a real feel for Boston plus it's very close to downtown and the airport. \n",
            "\n",
            "Baljinder was a gentlemen and very helpful. Well priced, best case scenario for me!\n",
            "- - Hervorragende & freundliche Kommunikation mit den Gastgebern während des gesamten Aufenthaltes. \n",
            "- Viele zusätzlich bereit gestellte Annehmlichkeiten wie Kaffee und auch Toilettenartikel im Badezimmer\n",
            "- Täglich frische Handtücher\n",
            "- Freies WLAN\n",

            "- ruhige Nachbarschaft\n",
            "> Insgesamt eine sehr positive Bewertung\n",
            "- Great experience! The apartment was great, and the hosts had fresh flowers and a candle waiting for when we got there, and were amazing hosts. We were given fresh towels everyday, more than we could use. The apartment also had a Keurig, k-cups, and tea in the kitchen area. Uber to the North End was about $12. Overall an awesome experience! \n",
            "- This place was so convenient for my 2 nights spent in Boston. It was nicely renovated and the bed was super comfy. A great quiet neighbourhood as well! Thanks so much for a wonderful experience Baljinder!\n",
            "- This was an experience I couldn't wait to write a review about. Baljinder and Sandra's place was my fourth Airbnb experience, and it has simply been the best one so far. My parents and I stayed here only for one night, but we were treated like family friends. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our flight from Buffalo to Boston on the check-in day got cancelled so we had to find another flight with a different airline at a later time. When we notified Baljinder and Snadra about the later check in time, they kindly offered to give us a ride from the airport to their house!! Not only that, they also offered to give my parents a ride the next day early morning at 3:50am. Giving rides are not part of their responsibility as a host, but they chose to do it because they know how exhausting and frustrating change in travel plans can be and because they believe in quality customer care. Their kind act allowed my parents to leave the country with a very good impression of the city. \n",
            "\n",
            "As for the apartment itself, the place is accurately described (even better than the photos). It's really 5 minutes drive from the Logan airport, every basic necessities were provided, and I could smell the fresh laundry detergent on the pillow cases. The sheets and blankets were also very clean and fresh to the skin. They also have Keurig, paper towel, necessary kitchen supplies etc. The living room has a well functioning AC, and in the livingroom (the pullout couch is very comfortable to sleep in) has ceiling fan and a giant stand fan to keep it cool. Real flowers in the vase was a very nice touch. They were very lovely, and my mom loved them. \n",
            "\n",
            "I would not hesitate to recommend this place to everyone who visits Boston. Both hosts and the apartment can't get any better than this. Thank you Baljinder and Sandra for a memorable stay at your place! I really hope more people would work with you in the future. \n",
            "- Super friendly and accommodating. Made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Boston!\n",
            "- Everything as expected, nice clean and spacious space. Baljinder and Sandra were very reactive, even if we didn't meet but they responded very quickly to my mails providing information asked. They even arranged for an early check-in. This place is perfect if you're flying early as it is located very close to the airport...\n",
            "- Nice apartment close to Logan Airport. We parked our car at Logan Economy Parking ($23/day) and walked from there (~15 mins). Sandra and Baljinder were really nice and responsive (e.g. offering to keep our luggage for the following day). We appreciated a big fridge and complimentary coffee. Somebody could mind missing AC in the kitchen (we did not). If you are looking for a short stay before you flight from Logan, this is a perfect match.\n",
            "- Honestly... I really wanted to like this place. However, it really wasn't my cup of tea. Upon arrival, the light that was in the corridor leading up to the apartment was not working, and it also smelled odd. The top light in the front bedroom also did not work, and so even though there was a side lamp in the room, it didn't help that much. I was not told where to find the wifi password or what it was until I asked, and the air conditioning in the room was so loud that it was impossible to sleep with it on. I understand that the owner most likely did all they could to make this a great place to stay, but personally I did not feel safe in the area or apartment, and wouldn't stay here again. \n",
            "- Worked out just fine\n",
            "- Nothing but good things to say about our stay. The unit was incredibly clean, and contained every amenity one could hope for. The newly-installed a/c worked wonderfully! We'll be back.\n",
            "- Baljinder was extremely responsive in our communication. Room was more or less as described. Thanks for a great first airbnb experience!\n",
            "- The apartment was just as described - it was clean, spacious enough for three people and there was a kitchen so we were able to cook. The apartment was quiet and the neighborhood okay; it was also not very far from downtown Boston.\n",
            "- The place was exactly what we needed it to be. Affordable spot close to the airport and an easy Uber ride downtown. Would definitely recommend this to anyone spending a weekend in Boston.\n",
            "- Our stay was great! Baljinder actually met us outside the apartment- which wasn't supposed to happen but was super nice! He walked my husband and I inside and explained where everything was, where to leave the keys the next day, etc. and told us to be sure to contact him if we needed anything... Then gave us directions to where we wanted to go! He was super accommodating as well- I was in contact with him about two weeks before the trip letting him know about potential travel plans, as we fly stand-by and things aren't always set in stone; he made sure that we were taken care of! The apartment itself was clean and decorated nicely. There were several different amenities provided: coffee, tea, shampoo, conditioner, body wash; we didn't lack for anything. I wish we could've stayed longer! I highly recommend it! \n",
            "- Very convenient, well equipped apartment.  Host was easy to work with and helpful.\n",
            "- Baljinder and his wife Sandra were extremely welcoming and accommodating. The place was very clean and ready when I arrived. They even went so far as to let me store my bags there the day that I checked out because I didn't have to fly out for 6 hours and wanted to go downtown. I would recommend this place and them to anyone!\n",
            "- I had a very nice stay at t this apartment. The host was extremely welcoming and accommodating, but also gave me all the privacy I needed. \n",
            "- Great location. Quite neighborhood. Place was nice and clean. Baljinder meet with me told me of some great places to eat\n",
            "- Spacious indeed. A great place to stay and have a nice night before early flight to other place!\n",
            "- One minute away from Jackson square t station. Room huge and comfortable although the bed on wheels was funny at times when trying to have a morning coffee in bed! Free on street parking. No noise. Thanks for the stay :-)\n",
            "- The apartment is really close to the Jackson Square station and neighborhood is ok. The room was really big, clean and quiet (it looks exactly as the pictures), the bathroom was clean too. We have not seen Diego but his roomates and they were really friendly. Thank you for the stay !\n",
            "- The room is really big and clean. The public space is clean as well. There is a subway station near the house, so it is really convenient for the tourist.\n",
            "- We had a wonderful stay at Diego's. The room was very spacious and clean as was the bathroom. Didn't get a chance to meet Diego but he responded to his messages in a timely manner. The only negative was that the bedroom door didn't have a lock and key.  \n",
            "- This room is pretty clean and comfy. Although I didn't get to see Diego, the other housemates are nice and chill. The place is a bit far from the downtown Boston, but the train station is super close so it doesn't really matter. But the wifi is pretty weak and slow so it's kinda frustrating. Except for this, Diego's room is great:)\n",
            "- The room was great and the instructions were very clear. He has roommates and they were very respectful and understanding.\n",
            "- L'appartement est situé à deux pas du métro et lit confortable.\n",
            "Nous n'avons pas rencontré Diego lors de notre séjour à Boston.\n",
            "- The place is alright. What I loved the most about the place was that it was close to the train. It was convenient. Also, I was disappointed how the room wasn't ready when got there. And the bed squeeked every time i moved, it also had wheels so it wouldnt stay in place. However, the overall I would give 4/5\n",
            "- Diego didn't respond to my initial request within the first 24 hours of the booking and only contacted me after that to tell me the place was still available. Given that I was arriving the following day at that point, I wasn't thrilled about the late response, but I resent the request and booked with him. I didn't meet Diego and only met one roommate briefly, but the listing is exactly as described and the instructions Diego provided were helpful. The location is very close to the Jackson Square T stop, and convenient to local shops and the grocery store. Street parking was easy and Diego even provided towels, which was great. The door to the bedroom can be locked from the inside, although it doesn't stay very well. \n",
            "- Staying at Diego's wasn't the best Airbnb experience I had: although the room was quite clean and just as it looks in the listing, the shared bathroom was extremely dirty, the water in the shower wasn't flowing down well and you were left in a pond of dirty and hair: nasty! another unhappy surprise was the rat that would cross your way in the backyard before getting to the entry door. As for this last detail which is probably something quite common in big cities , the condition of the bathroom is quite unacceptable...he wasn't there so I don't know if the other roommates had any responsibilities for leaving such a mess  but if you are hosting someone you need to make sure the place is in a decent condition plus all the hair around can't be left in a day only, meaning that the place hadn't been cleaned in a while. Besides this, which can be fixed by paying a little more attention I think the place has the potentials to be a nice Airbnb experience.  \n",
            "- Place is in a prime location! 1 min to the mtba makes it easy to get in and out of downtown or the airport easy peasy. Rooms are basic as they come, but makes up in convenience. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a roof. Cheers!!\n",
            "- I didn't meet Rex in person but he was very understanding and helpful. The location is great. Super close to the train station and the revere beach.  The room is small and basic but clean and quiet. Overall, I had a very nice stay. \n",
            "- please fix the door\n",
            "- Rex's place was a comfortable stay and the price was ideal. Although the location changed we made the best of it and being that it was located near public transportation getting around was not difficult not to mention the beach was literally a 5min walk! \n",
            "- Logement très bien organisé, agréable et dans un quartier joli. 15 minutes du métro à pied. Places de parking très facile à trouver. \n",
            "- The Roseclair was a good fit for our needs - we were coworkers traveling for work, needing a place we could make some simple breakfasts (Stop & Shop is really closeby), and that would be a reasonable commute to our office and to the airport. Two bedrooms were big, with enough room to do some morning stretches, and one was smaller. The common room was a nice spot for post-work relaxing.  We all thought it would be a good place for future trips like this.  I'm a light sleeper, so I was bothered a couple nights by airplane and traffic noise, but Boston tends to be loud - that's just how it is.  The shower was great!\n",
            "- Our Sales team had a really nice stay, the bedrooms were beautiful, and the apartment is very nice. Our hosts were friendly and able to assist with any questions/concerns they had.\n",
            "- We had a lovely stay at the Roseclair. The space was great for our family of 6, and the place was beautiful. Definitely recommend. \n",
            "- We really enjoyed our stay in the Roseclair in Boston! The apartment was great! It is very comfortable, clean and well decorated. Thank you very much for having us! \n",
            "- Thank you for an excellent option within Boston area at affordable price. The place is well maintained with easy access into and out of the city\n",
            "-  Apartment was clean and well equipped. Beds were comfortable and kitchen had all the basic necessities. The main problem was  traffic noise which was considerable from about 6 AM till midnight.   Also it would be convenient if host provided a resident parking pass to allow for side street parking. \n",
            "- Beautiful and charming multi-unit home, perfectly maintained and 10-15min from everything I needed (conference center, Seaport, North End and Financial District). This a slick operation. Do not hesitate to work with these guys! I saved thousands vs. using a hotel this week. Thank you Mr. Swank and to everyone on the Swank team!\n",
            "- Notre arrivée s'est passée avec beaucoup de facilités .\n",
            "Après ces heures de voyage nous nous sommes sentis secure et confortables.\n",

            "\n",
            "- The unit was great, Very clean. Had just about everything i needed for my 3 night stay. Roomed my party of 5 perfectly. Very charming space and convenient location with a restaurant/bar right next door.  Everything within walking distance. Would recommend coming back.\n",
            "- This place was so great!! It was clean, easy to access from the highway, and close to everything you could want or need! I loved that it felt like a hotel and I felt safe arriving late at night. The street got a bit busy during the day, but the traffic moved along well and it never took long to access the highway during busy times. Parking close was never an issue and it was just an overall comfortable place to stay! We'll definitely be back when we visit again!\n",
            "- Lance and Swank were on top of everything. We arrived very late but had no problems getting in and getting settled. In the morning we explored the neighborhood and found it great. The information provided about the unit and Boston were all very helpful. We used the Uber link and discount so thanks for that! We had a problem resetting the temperature control when we got home late one evening, emailed Swank and within about 10 minutes it was fixed...they really are available 24/7 as advertised. \n",
            "- Kara was professional and fast to response. We liked the place. It was as described and exactly like the pictures shown on the site. It was clean, tidy and nice. The neighborhood was also great, walking distance to the chinatown and downtown. Would come back again and contact Kara for our future long stay in Boston. \n",
            "- It was a pleasant stay. Customer service is available & requests are mostly completed in the next day. \n",
            "- Danielle was an amazing hostess!!! She was very accommodating despite last minute arrangement and an extremely late arrival time. Her apartment is beyond stunning and belongs on a magazine cover and the area is great. Highly, highly recommend staying here!!!\n",
            "- It was such a cute place! Perfect for me and my fiancé and a long weekend getaway. We felt like we were right in the middle of everything! Couldn't get much better than that. The only thing that we wished we had known was that there wasn't air conditioning. It was tolerable with the fan she provided but still a little hot--it was cooler outside.\n",
            "Other than that, the building is beautiful, the room cozy, & clean! Overall great spot! Danielle was great!\n",
            "- First, the location is ideal.  From it, we walked everywhere, and were able to run along the Charles just a  block away.  The neighborhood is charming.  But the best is the space. It is very cleverly organized and we enjoyed being there very much.  We wanted for nothing.  Danielle was also extremely accommodating when traffic did not cooperate with our planned arrival time.  We will recommend this flat to others.   \n",
            "- Apartment is very clean, spacious, and in a prime location steps away from the B, C, and D T lines. Host is very nice and friendly.\n",
            "- Everything about this listing is good: Location (Well connected with the local transport), Cleanliness, Spacious and a great host (Would respond to queries immediately). I just stayed here for a night but wouldn't have minded to stay here longer. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. \n",
            "- Comfortable 1-bedroom apartment was just what we were looking for! I was in town for one night with a friend, and we were mainly just looking for a place to crash after a concert. When I arrived, the host gave me the information we'd need while we were there: WiFi password, how to use the oven, etc. (even though we ended up not needing most of this). Overall a comfortable place to stay!\n",
            "- The stay is steps from the T, a comfortable place to end a day of sightseeing and has all the amenities to make for a great stay. Communication was quick and clear. Apartment left clean for us and was a great, affordable option for my wife and I to see the expensive city of Boston. Felt safe the whole time...even when a police officer was in the hall to investigate a domestic disturbance next door...never once had a concern for safety. Honestly, I wont look to a hotel again for extended stays.\n",

            "- Really great value and Jonathan was a great host! I didn't realize there was another room rented out via Airbnb in the unit too  (Jonathan and his family live in a separate unit downstairs) but the en suite bathroom and all the space offer plenty of privacy. Jonathan really thought of everything and the place is packed with all the amenities one could need. All around great place and great host! \n",
            "- Where nice place, clean, centrally located. Very good communication. Would stay again.\n",
            "- This was a lovely apartment, very clean, quiet and comfortable. It was very close to the S. Boston sea shore walking/jogging path and a park. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen had great appliances, bathrooms were clean and private. Instructions were clear. We would not hesitate to stay there again. \n",

            "- It's my first time travel with Airbnb. I definitely will recommend Jonathan's place to any traveller who want to enjoy the city like home. The location is very good. Only 5 mins walk away from Andrew Station and we can easily take subway to Harvard University, South Station via Andrew Station. On our first day from NYC to Boston, Jonathan gave me very good advice on transportation and made every thing easy. We live on the 3rd floor and have a private bathroom in my bedroom. The room is lovely with mint-color wall. The host is considerate and get everything prepared including bathroom stuff. We didn't see Jonathan and his family through out the 4 nights. So the privacy is PERFECT!  However, I can feel Jonathan around as he always respond quickly whenever I drew up a question message through Airbnb. >< I use the kitchen to cook instant noodles and LOBSTER what we found in Star Market. Star market is 5mins driving away and you can find very good and cheap food there, like my favourite Cherry which is much cheaper than NYC!! All in a word, I would like to go back on my next trip to Boston! Thank you Jonathan!!\n",
            "- Jonathan's place is a great value for the location only two stops away from South Station! The room was clean and check-in was seamless. Jonathan was responsive to my questions and my stay was private and quiet. Great access to the T so everything is walk-able. Would recommend staying here especially if you want to be close to Downtown at a reasonable price!\n",
            "- Travis and his wife's triplex was absolutely perfect for our trip to Boston for the Boston Marathon. The location is close to cute cafes to eat brunch and close to the train/subway station (literally a 5 min walk!) it was also a quiet neighborhood for this runner to sleep good! He left very detailed instructions and they were very nice when we did the key exchange with the cutest puppy! They were also flexible with the key drop off since we had an early flight back home. I would definitely recommend this place to other Air BnB fans! \n",
            "- Communicating with Abhishek was very easy, he responded quickly and the condo was exactly as described.  He even left some sweets for us to enjoy when we arrived.  I stayed here with my husband and 2 year old daughter and had more than enough space.  The location was an easy walk to many of the the places we wanted to go; Faneuil Hall, the Children's Museum, Aquarium, etc.  It was wonderful having a comfortable and convenient home base for our weekend in Boston.\n",
            "- The host left us a really nice note and a bar of chocolate to welcome us into their home. It was so nice (and delicious). The neighborhood is great. Right by South Station which makes it easy to get to and from the airport and we felt safe the entire time.\n",

It was 95 degrees outside but they had 2 air conditioners running and it was nice and cold inside!  Everything was right there, you can walk to everything.  I can't wait to stay here again!\n",
            "- Dror called very quickly and gave me friendly, thorough information.   The apartment needs some love.   The sofas appeared heavily used and discolored and I was not comfortable enough to sit on them, and the dinning table chairs were stiff and mismatched.   There was no place I was comfortable.  There was no interior lock on the front door and, being a woman staying alone, whenever people walked by in the hall I was a bit uncomfortable.  The bathroom was small but adequate and clean - there were no hand towels.  The kitchen was clean and much nicer than in the photo.  The location is great and this would be a nice place to stay if someone would make a trip to Ikea and spent $3-4k on new some furniture.     With additional fees I ended up spending $374 for one night.\n",

            "- By far the best thing about this apartment is the location. It really couldn't be better -- right in the middle of all the wonderful Italian restaurants and shops in the heart of the North End. It is also very spacious for the price -- two bedrooms and a large living room and kitchen/dining area. The beds were comfortable and there were sufficient essentials (kitchenware, towels, etc) for our stay. Overall, it was worth the price and I would stay here again. That said, there were some negatives. The heat was an issue. Apparently, the thermostat to this apartment (which we never actually found) controls the whole floor of the building and can't be adjusted. It was uncomfortably hot in the bedrooms at night. Luckily, we found a fan in one of the closets, but only one. The other problem was that my traveling companion is very allergic to cats. Although the apartment is listed \"no pets,\" she immediately had a severe reaction. In her estimation, there was either a cat in the apartment recently, or someone else on the floor had a cat and there were open vents. It was hard for her to spend a large amount of time in the apartment. Again, those issues were not so major that I wouldn't stay here again. It was generally a positive experience. \n",
            "- The apartment was very neat and clean. It is a really beautiful apartment in a great neighborhood. There are great restaurants and pastries right around the corner. Everything was prepared very well for us and we enjoyed our stay a lot! \n",
            "- The apartment was very nice and comfortable. We stayed there during the crazy Boston blizzard so it was good to have somewhere warm to bunker down. It's located in a good spot to go to the shops for groceries and alcohol, and close to the harbour which no doubt would be very enjoyable during less of a cold snap. Fantastic location, the North End of Boston is excellent for Italian food and culture. High ceilings and nice furniture make the place feel very homely. Had good sleeps with very comfortable bedding. Free internet was a bonus. Also the real estate agent is right next door which is helpful if there are any major problems (which we thankfully did not have). The television wouldn't work for us though we played around with it a lot and followed the written instructions, and the couches were a bit dirty. Minor gripes though, for the most part we had a great time and would stay again.\n",
            "- This was a great experience! Our group loved staying at this quaint and clean apartment right in the heart of Little Italy. Although we only stayed one night, Dror made an exception and welcomed us! We ate at a local restaurant just a few blocks down and it was delicious! Thank you for accommodating our group and having such a nice place! We will be back :) \n",
            "- This apt it's very clean, and its convenient, have a lot of little market around the apt, the host it's very kind.\n",
            "- Awesome location. The apartment was very comfortable and spacious. The couch was very comfortable and soft. The house was very clean and the bunk bed is amazing!!! The only con would be the wall is thin but the place had been around since forever :). Would totally come again!!\n",
            "- Description and pictures of the apartment were accurate. Very nice sized apartment. Only complaint was that it was SO hot inside and there are no heat controls in the unit. We had the windows open the whole 4/5 days.  Had pots, pans, playes, cutlery, etc. which was great. Location was perfect for us! Lots of restaurants, close to quincey market, the T, could walk to TD gardens and along the trail to Boston commons park. It is right across from a fire hall so be prepared for some sirens!\n",
            "- I had a wonderful experience here and highly recommend this apartment! The apartment was right across from a great breakfast spot and the walk to the train was not only beautiful but fast! Everything we needed was provided to us! Getting the keys was very quick and easy. There were 5 of us but we were very comfortable and had plenty of space! \n",
            "- The location was fabulous, within short walking distance of tons of great dining. The place itself was clean, well maintained, and was a great home away from home. It was an awesome way to experience Boston. The instructions were detailed and Dror was very helpful. I definitely would rent again next time I am in the Boston area and would recommend the space to my friends.\n",
            "- The apartment was just as described.  We had plenty of room (the bathroom was a little small, but putting the small end table in helped with space to put things).  The neighborhood was good, and close to everything.  We had one small \"snafu\", but it was taken care of in minutes, and we even got a follow-up call shortly after from Dror to ensure we were taken care of to our satisfaction (we were).  \n",
            "- The location is great! Very nice area and close to the Haymarket T station. Beds were comfortable, nice clean sheets and towels. Very nice kitchen and bathroom. Furniture is definitely worn, but sufficient. The main issue was that the heat is controlled for the whole floor, so you can't adjust it. We had to leave the windows open the whole time, which meant there was a decent amount of noise. Check in and out was very easy, great communication! Thanks!\n",
            "- This is a great apartment in the heart of Little Italy! Uber drivers were very impressed with the location as we were dropped off. This is a real local's experience! \n",

            "- This was a beautiful location in the heart of Little Italy.  Check-in was exactly as we were told, we got the keys and went upstairs to the apartment to drop our bags and then took a stroll up Hanover Street and over to Long Wharf.  The area was perfect and as first time visitors to Boston, we found the notes extremely helpful when getting around.  \n",

Boston is a very walkable city - Host was nice - communication prior to arrival great - Keys left for us in Lock box.  Apartment is spacious and clean.  New Kitchen.  Couple of minor things: the furniture is showing a bit of wear and they could use a few more fans.  The Window  AC units are great for the Living/Dining area but the cool air doesn't reach the bedrooms so much.  \n",

            "First, you get emails saying you have to print this thing and bring it with you. There are a lot of rules about checking in. I was on a long trip with over 5 air bnbs and none I worried about checking into like this one. When I called to verify my check in, it was an agency and after a long hold the girl asked me what time I would be there. I said, \"how about around 12:00?\" She said check in is at 2:00 I said so, \"I'll come at 2:00?\" She said that was when check in was. Ok, not bad just not normal air bnb coolness. \n",

Be prepared for a fairly big parking fee...but cheaper then the tows, boots and tickets we witnessed in the residence parking areas. BTW...we are big firemen fans. Feel free to support the BFD and buy a great looking t-shirt at the station across the street. If you enjoy dealing with professionalism you will enjoy working with Dror and his team.

            "- While looking for a place to stay in Boston, I was immediately drawn to Dror's well appointed apartment in North End. The location is perfect. Dror quickly responded to our reservation request, and the rest of our correspondence with him and the realty team was very easy.\n",
            "\n",
            "We didn't spend much time in the apartment because we were busy seeing everything Boston has to offer, but we found that the apartment had everything we needed: coffee maker, TV, comfy beds, and a breakfast nook. We had a quick, convenient walk to the T or it was easy to hail a cab or uber in front of the apartment. \n",
            "\n",
            "Thank you for being a gracious host, Dror!\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "- My family and I really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. It was spacious enough, and the location was excellent. The kitchen was great, as it allowed us to store food we brought home, and cook as well. Overall, a sweet place. Thank you Dror/Zoë Realty/Cara!\n",
            "- Wonderful location in the North End. Close to all the busy areas on Hanover but quiet and private. The condo had everything we needed and more. Would love to stay here again. \n",
            "- Muy buena ubicacion en North End.\n",
            "El segundo cuarto tiene una puerta a la escalera de emergencia, no tiene ventana.\n",

            "- The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",

            "\n",
            "- Our experience was fantastic! Location could not be better in the North End. The apartment was perfect size and had all the amenities we needed for our short weekend stay. Even though the apartment is right on Hanover street, it is surprisingly quiet and the air conditioner was a life savor on our hot weekend holiday. The decor is beautiful and all the furniture is practical and very comfortable. Would highly recommend!\n",
            "- We could not have found a better location for our short stay in Boston! The apartment is just what the pictures show: furniture and decoration very contemporary, convenient little kitchen and bathroom, big windows in the living (not in the rooms) and lots of light, which makes the room very happy. Very clean and well taken care of. We will be coming back.\n",
            "- It was a pleasure to meet rob, he made us feel extremely welcome and at home. I was a little nervous about renting this place as it is a new listing without any reviews. You couldn't ask for a better location, close to anything and everything you may want to do in Boston.  Parking is a little tough though I found a parking garage a few blocks away. The space is exactly as pictured, perfect for a couple or even with extra traveler if they are ok with a cozy couch. Super comfy bed and extremely hot water. Rob was flexible enough to allow us some extra time to check out in the morning which was such a great help!  We had more time to check out the neighborhood, so many great restaurants, shops, bars and music venues right at your fingertips. . You got to check out the best ice cream shop in Boston which is at your front doorstep.  I'll definitely be back again! \n",
            "- First thing, the location is FANTASTIC. I don't think you can find another place at the same location for a price like this. It's basically the center of Boston. There are restaurants all around and it's 5 minutes from Apple Store, Trader Joe's, the Prudential Center(a huge mall) and close to colleges like Berklee School of Music, Boston University and Northeastern University. I came to Boston for college visits, so it was super convenient for me.\n",
            "Also, Rob is THE best host I've ever met. He came to give me the key personally when I arrived. I lost the key during a tour and he was able to make a new key in a few hours and gave it to me. I also happened to have a friend who wanted to stay over that I didn't mention before the trip, and Rob was okay with it. When I left, Rob gave me a ride to the train station and asked my opinions about the apartment.\n",
            "There can be more blankets and the apartment can use a new shower head, but those are the minor things that can be easily fixed in a short amount of time.\n",
            "Overall, it's definitely worth the price!\n",
            "- Had a good stay at Rob's place. He was super flexible in meeting time to get keys. I stayed for the Boston Marathon weekend which is super hectic and he was super great in not making it more complicated. Super convenient location. \n",
            "- Great stay . Robs place is very central and Rob was very kind to accommodate small requests like an extra blanket and finding a place for the bags while we visited the city. The place is cosy and big enough for a small family. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wishes to be in the heart of the city amidst all its history and the hub bub. \n",
            "- We had a one major problem with the apartment: we did not understand from the description that the bed is not located on the floor.  It is on a platform about 4' off the ground, accessed by a narrow ladder.  When in the double bed, there is maybe 3' of clearance to the ceiling.  This may not be a problem for a younger users, or one without a disability.  It was not a good experience for us, either going to bed or getting out of bed or getting up in the night.  There was no light by the led. The location is on a third floor with a narrow staircase was not convenient.  The bathroom was clean but in need to repairs.  \n",
            "\n",
            "If there is already a warning about this in the description, it is our error and we missed it.  Our rating would then go to a 3*.\n",
            "\n",
            "In every other way, the flat is excellent: clean, basics provided and Rob was timely, welcoming and responsive.  The location is perfect with so many good things to do just nearby. \n",
            "- This was our first time traveling with Airbnb. From the beginning Rob was very accommodating and was quick to responding to any questions I had. Rob did let me know that we could set up for transportation from the airport for 50 dollars. I did not know that the host would be picking us up and we did have to wait almost an hour for our pick up. I guess I would just recommend taking a taxi or the bus because you will pay a lot less. The place was nice and looked just like the pictures. We did have 3 people staying in the apartment which I wouldn't recommend because one will be staying on a pull out couch. Bring blankets and pillows! Rob was very kind and brought us pillows and blankets when we requested but no pillow cases and no sheets. The place was clean and perfect for a small family. The location of the apartment was amazing! We were right in the middle of everything. I went there for a conference at Hynes conventional center. It would literally take me three minutes to get to my classes. I do have to say it is very loud in the back ally. We woke up every morning at 3:30 am to load noises like garbage pick up or something. It was pretty bad. There is some construction going on which also made it difficult to sleep but I am sure that will be done soon. One little thing that kind of made me a little mad was the fact there was a television but the internet did not connect to it to watch any type of tv. This wasn't a big deal but its annoying having a tv in the living room and not being able to do anything with it. Overall, this place is perfect for a short trip and very clothes to basically everything. There is a ice cream and coffee right below the apartment. \n",
            "- Great place, with great space, and the location it's in is fantastic! Literally in the middle of a very neat & decorative area. \n",
            "\n",
            "Rob is a great communicator, and is the type of host that will make accommodations for you to make your stay as comfortable as can be. \n",
            "\n",
            "I appreciated the snacks in the refrigerator and the multiple kitchen utensils and cutleries. \n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "- Rob was very accommodating to us when one of our flights was delayed many hours. He met us to let us into the condo and was very accommodating. The location was fantastic!! The back alley does get noisy early in the morning with the arrival of the garbage trucks but the street is full of shopping and restaurants and is walkable to Fenway! We tried to turn the tv on but it didn't seem to be connected. After a long day of being tourists it would have been nice to come back and be able to watch the baseball games on tv and unwind. Highly recommend this place!!\n",
            "- Overall it was a good experience with Rob. He showed up timely with the key and even let us store our luggage for several hours after our check out time.\n",
            "The studio looks just like the photos and is in an incredible location. \n",
            "I want to mention a few things that have not been previously noted: The apartment is on the 3rd floor and there is no elevator.  There is no microwave, but there is an oven and George Forman grill.  Lastly, there is no air conditioning. It was very warm being on the third floor and the bed being up high in the room. We stayed there in mid May and it was the warmest days of the year. Mid seventies. We had trouble sleeping a few nights due to the heat. I'm assuming previous reviews didn't address it because it was chilly.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, Rob will add a window AC unit.  That being said, I would most definitely stay here if I visit Boston again.\n",
            "- Rob made Check-in and check-out very easy.  And the room was nice and clean when we arrived. The room was located in the perfect location on Newbury St. with great shops and restaurants all within walking distance. Highly recommended!\n",
            "- Rob easy to contact initially. The place is in a great location on newberry street round the corner from the convention centre. However there was no air conditioning for a 3rd floor apartment in Boston and the first night was hot and the bedroom does not have a fan above the bed so had to move the mattress into the lounge to be under the fan. The kitchen has a simple stove with no microwave. The TV is brand new it not connected to regular TV or cable and to watch TV you need a computer with an HDMI cable which I did not have, thus unable to watch TV. The Internet connection was great and could use around Boston not only in the apartment. There was no iron so had to buy one - should be one there now. The bed was comfy but only a bottom sheet provided and a thin blanket for covering. there was no hot water over the kitchen sink as the tap was broken. The bathroom was good with nice shower and hot water there!\n",
            "Rob responded to my questions but did not provide aircon when asked. Was very aloof when I arrived. He did meet me late in evening when I arrived however. He was very quick to leave and I had to find most things myself\n",
            "Overall the stay was just ok. Would need to improve before I stayed there again for the price. \n",
            "- My host made me feel welcome, and the neighborhood was very nice.  I felt safe. \n",
            "\n",
            "Even though I feel my stay was good, I think there were a few things that might have made my stay even better.  I was able to still have a good time without a microwave, coffee maker, and TV system,  but I think these would probably have made my stay better.  However, the lack of these did not create any real problem for me since I was able to use my laptop with the free wifi (which was a great feature) and boil water with Starbucks singles for coffee without any problems.  \n",
            "\n",
            "However, the problems were more in the lack of sheets and towels.  Once again I did OK with only one bottom sheet and bedspread but an additional top sheet would have been better.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Even having only 2 bath towels was OK except for the fact that there was nothing for the bottom of the shower.  Either a rubber shower mat or an additional towel would have made my showers more stable.  I worried a bit about slipping in the shower though I had little trouble keeping this from happening to me.  I worry though that other people who may stay in 290 Newbury St. could slip and fall in the shower causing perhaps bad results for them but also they could very well end up suing the landlords.  I think a wise thing would be to make a relatively inexpensive purchase for a rubber shower mat to make available or at least additional towels.  These are very inexpensive compared to a possible lawsuit.  If I were a landlord, I would definitely consider this.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Apart from these criticisms, my stay was very good.\n",
            "- The location is really convenient to get to everything you need, the place is warm and cute \n",
            "- Robs place was exactly as expected. Clean and tidy. Excellent location for exploring Boston. He was also extremely flexible with us in terms of check in and check out. Thanks for a great stay!\n",
            "- First off I just have to say that the location of this place is AMAZING, right in the middle of a very active and bustling street with sidewalk cafes, restaurants and stores. Rob was a gracious host meeting us in person and also allowing us to check out a little later than was stated in order to accommodate our next day's plans. Our stay was just one night but I would love to have stayed and enjoyed this place for longer. \n",
            "- My trip to Boston was one of the best I've had recently, and a significant part of it was because of my accommodation. Rob met me personally on the afternoon of my arrival and he was very gracious to have allowed me to check in 30 mins earlier than scheduled. The place was as described. It wasn't a palace by any measure but it will fit 4 comfortably. The main bed is on a loft so if you have issues climbing a ladder, maybe you'll need to pull out the sofa bed. The thing that makes Rob's place a jewel find was the location. It's on the tail end of Newbury St. Newbury is a quaint tree-lined street with shops and restaurants and the architecture is amazing. It runs parallel to two major streets: Commonwealth (think Boston's version of a Parisian avenue) and Boylton (shopping). It's a bit of a walk to the nearest T station but that didn't really bother me. This place is perfect if you're on a budget but still would like to stay in the happening part of town. Boston's a pretty expensive city so Rob's apartment is a great find.\n",
            "- Exactly as advertised.\n",
            "- Good place for budget traveler - small and basic but has what you need and is well kept. Great coffee nearby. One thing to bear in mind: The alley the bedroom faces can be noisy late at night.\n",
            "- For this price, get a hotel room. While the location of Rob's apartment is good, the actual place was not. It was quite dirty and provides guest with the bare minimum. For two beds, there was only one set of sheets so you were forced to sleep with the blankets right against your skin (probably not washed after each guest). The toilet paper provided was one-tier only . The wall paper in the shower is falling apart. We even had to remove the excess water from the air-conditioner in order for it to work properly. In addition to the condition of the place, check-in was very inflexible and Rob didn't show up for the check out at 10 (we left at 11 without actually seeing him). \n",
            "- Great location. A lot of space. Rob was easy to communicate with. \n",
            "- Great location, but not a great experience. Host was friendly and helpful upon arrival, but due to travel, unable to help during our stay.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the property was clean, we were only able to use one of the two beds due to lack of sheets, and even that bed only had a bottom sheet. The main bed is in a low-ceilinged loft and accessible by a ladder, so not great for anyone with physical challenges or older travelers. Also, A/C was insufficient during very hot weather.\n",
            "\n",
            "Might be a good pick if you don't mind giving up a bit of comfort, as the location was fantastic.\n",
            "- Rob was timely and communicated well. The place is very well located. That was our main concern, and was generally not out of the range of what I was expecting. However, our original request to the host via airbnb made clear we were a party of three (I just verified this). It had, as advertised, a loft bed and a hide-a-bed. When we came back for bedtime after the 4.5 hr. Red Sox game, we realized that the loft had only a cover sheet and the hide-a-bed had no bedding at all. It seemed unreasonable to call the host to drive over bedding at midnight, and I wasn't really that mad about it. I volunteered to sleep on the hide-a-bed on top of two towels and a tiny airline blanket (the closest thing to spare bedding around). When we contacted the host the next morning to say he might do better with bedding next time, he responded by saying he'd only wished he'd known we were a party of three. Aside from the fact he had this information, why would a host assume everyone would use one bed when two are advertised? I wasn't planning on posting anything about this, but the response made me feel like the host was stretching to blame us--after I'd just spent the night on towels for $300--instead of just apologizing and thanking for the feedback.\n",
            "- Host made it very easy for us to check in on our time.  The apartment was way to hot.  We only chose this apartment for location and for sleeping, which was not even possible due to poor air conditioning.\n",
            "- Rob was wonderful. Quick to reply, throughly asked if everything was okay, and made sure it was comfortable. If you are looking for a nice place in Boston for around 3 people or less, I would not pass this up. Very convient location and easy to find restaurants and stops for the T. I highly recommend staying through Rob!\n",
            "- The apartment was as advertised.  The location is fabulous, around the corner from the Hynes convention center and from Trader Joe's.  However, it was extremely hot, being on the top floor.  In addition, the bed is on a loft and does not get cooled by the bedroom's fan.  We slept on the couch in the living room, under a fan and adjacent to the AC that the host provided.\n",
            "- Location is perfect for the price. Host (Rob) was very friendly altough I was a bit late with check-in. Also, Rob allowed me to stay for couple for hours for late check out.\n",
            "- Perfect host. Only \"complaint\" would be price as this is more expensive than other locations for an older unit. Overall, I recommend Rob, he is kind and worked with us. He has firm grasp of customer service and is very accommodating. He made sure we had everything we needed for a successful trip to boston. Thank you Rob. Would recommend to family and friends. \n",
            "- Rob met us promptly and the apt was clean and nicely set up. Great location for a trip to Fenway. Easy walk with all the fans!\n",
            "- Rob was very accommodating and extremely responsive. Anytime I needed to ask a question he responded within 15 minutes! That sets him apart from most hosts. The location was in a safe neighborhood with plenty of amenities within walking distance. Location was key for me as a single woman walking to classes at my school down the street. It was warm the first day, but Rob has provided a wonderful AC unit that kept the place very comfortable for the remainder of the trip. I had a little problem getting and staying connected to the internet, but I was at least able to access occasionally. It was a whirlwind week in Boston, but having a safe place so close to where I needed to be was wonderful!  \n",
            "- Rob's house was good, but not exactly as advertised. I had to carry four huge suitcases up 3 flights of stairs and that really took a toll on me. Most of the food in the apartment looked it had already been opened. The wifi too, was really slow and laggy. The only upside was the neighbouring area as there was proximity to the best of Boston's shopping and culture.\n",
            "- Alicia was wonderfully responsive and attentive to our needs before and during our stay. The apartment was clean and comfy with all the amenities we could ask for. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, but centrally located to public transit and many cultural and tourist attractions. There are great restaurants and cafes in the area, along with a nice grocery store just a few minutes away. Check in and out was a breeze. Overall this was the perfect place!\n",
            "- This was my first Airbnb experience and it has sincerely set my bar high! The space itself is very clean, cute, and right by the T. I was always more than comfortable and had the best shower experience of my life. The host is amazing (friendly, approachable, and just plain great!) and she truly made the whole experience easy and memorable. I definitely was never in need of anything. Overall, she went over and above my expectations and I can't imagine anyone being unhappy here. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!\n",
            "- Karen is the most wonderful and warmest host you can ever imagine. The moment I walked in I very much felt at home. The apartment is lovely, very clean, and it is conveniently located close to a T stop. The room has everything you need, even for an extended stay. The bed is really comfortable. Karen’s attention to details in order to make your stay as comfortable as possible is just great: There were flowers on my bedside table when I arrived, fresh towls were ready for me (and changed during my stay, as well as the linens). Communication before and during the stay was very easy and supernice. Jamaica Plain is a residential neighborhood, just a 15 min. train ride away from downtown Boston/Massachusetts Avenue, with cafés, shops, and laundry facilities close by, but nevertheless it’s calm and laid-back. I would most definitely stay there again! Thanks so much!\n",
            "- Staying at Karen’s place was a pleasure! The lovely, clean and neat house is in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Easy access with Orange T which is within a 3-minute walk. Karen is a super friendly and a welcoming host. Her cat Kosi is adorable. I would definitely stay here again next time in Boston. I loved my experience here - it felt like staying with a friend. Thank you very much, Karen.\n",

            "- This was my most positive Airbnb experience yet. I stayed with Karen while looking for and moving into a new apartment and she made the whole transition so much easier. Her place is right in the heart of my favorite neighborhood of Boston and the living space was great. Karen is happy to give you the low down on where to go/eat, and is generally just a pleasure to be around. 10/10 would recommend.\n",
            "- Karen was a fantastic host- super friendly and flexible. We absolutely loved her apartment and exploring the local area. The T line is minutes away and it didn't take anytime to get into downtown Boston. Thanks for a lovely stay!!!\n",
            "- This place was very cute and the neighborhood very friendly.  Karen was an awesome host.  If you had any questions she was very responsive to them and always had a positive attitude.  The summer in Boston is very warm and the place has no AC but she provided me with a couple fans which helped.  Her description is very accurate and I had no issues with this stay.  If staying near the T is also important for you then this is a perfect place to stay.\n",
            "- I had such a great time staying at Karen's! \n",
            "The house was perfect and Jamaica plain is a beautiful neighbourhood. Karen couldn't have been more accommodating (and lovely). \n",

Karen is a fantastic hostess, her home is comfortable, safe, and a two minute walk to the Orange line, Green stop..  She was quite helpful with her suggestions for getting around and even helped me find a couple yoga classes and book a massage.  Definitely a \"do again\" experience. Thank you Karen !\n",

            "The apartment had all we needed for a comfortable short stay. The kitchen was fully equipped and the bathroom had a full bath and shower. The pull down bed was very comfy, as was the living room area. Free wifi and tv were also appreciated. \n",
            "We met Richard and Victoria and they were charming hosts. We were unfortunate to be visiting during the Boston marathon explosions and the resulting city lockdown and Richard was very accommodating, allowing us to stay until the lockdown was lifted. \n",
            "We definitely recommend this apartment and Boston as a whole. It is a beautiful city with the friendliest people you could hope to meet. Our honeymoon here was wonderful. \n",
            "- Richard runs a very professional operation, but with a hart. The quality is very high: from the soap (we liked the roses scent very much) to the kitchen equipment and silverware the quality is excellent. The apartment is located in a very beautiful green area in the south end. We only would have liked a little bit more space, as the apartment is rather smallish.\n",
            "- Richard and Victoria were terrific hosts. The instructions were clear and everything went so smoothly. The Studio was in a perfect location -walking distance to shopping, restaurants, Fenway, etc. We look forward to returning. \n",
            "- This is a studio apartment, so it is small. But the furnishings are lovely, the kitchen and bathroom appear to be recently renovated, and the fold out bed gives you extra room during the day. The apartment has everything you would need for a short or extended stay and was in immaculate condition when we arrived. \n",

            "- This is a beautifully appointed studio situated in a lovely street in a great neighborhood.

            "- Nice apartment in a good location. Hosts were very accommodating - we were traveling on business, and needed to get something shipped to meet us. We ended up having it shipped to their office, and we found it in our apartment when we arrived. They definitely saved the day. \n",
            "- Our stay at the South End Studio was seamless - the suite is small, but cleaner than any hotel we've been too.  It was stylish, comfortable and just perfect for what we needed!  Richard helped us through our first stay through Airbnb and answered questions quickly.  The location was perfect for traveling on the T and walking around Boston.  We will definitely return again!\n",
            "- We had an excellent stay at this apartment.  Richard is a terrific host.  Everything from the reservation process to check-in/check-out was very organized and professional.

            "- Richard was a fantastic host. He gave us all the information to find the apartment easily and get settled in the area. The apartment itself was fabulous, extremely clean and very well equipped. I would recommend any of his listings, everything was thought about and taken care of. A better experience than many hotels.\n",
            "- The apartment and locality were as described. The Boston T was easilyly accessible making getting around the city and to and from the airport very easy. As an extra touch the host left us two bottles of wine which was lovely. When we arrived the apartment was very clean and well presented, being well stocked with all the things needed to make it an enjoyable stay.\n",
            "- Richard was very communicative and prompt in replying to my questions. The place was exactly as described, super clean, and easy to check into. The attention to detail was much appreciated, including a helpful list of phone numbers, services, and nearby attractions. I stayed there for five days while I was on a business trip at the Hynes Convention Center, and the location couldn't have been more perfect. The flat had all the necessities one could need, and was the perfect size for a single person or a couple. It's on a beautiful tree lined street - quiet, atmospheric, and picturesque - and just a minutes away from restaurants and other amenities. I opted for the professional cleaning as I was quite busy with work; I thought $150 was a bit high, but the place was so clean and tidy upon my arrival that it was worth it. And it's nice that they offer a \"self-clean\" option for those who are budget minded. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean, quiet space in the South End area! Thanks for a great stay, Richard!\n",
            "- Very professional and timely communication ; the apartment is very nice, very clean, in a nice area, very conveniently located next to the Convention Center. I particularly appreciated the detailed instructions and the welcome gift. I highly recommend.\n",
            "- This studio was clean and beautifully presented. It has everything you could need as a base to explore Boston, in particular the shared laundry (once we found it) was a godsend. Also, while I was apprehensive about the fold away bed it proved to be quite comfortable. The communication from Richard was great, and the little extra touches throughout the apartment were definitely appreciated. The only real negative for this studio is the upstairs neighbour who has a tendency to stomp and play semi-loud music. However this never caused us any great disturbance. Overall I was very impressed with the studio and wouldn't hesitate recommending it to others. \n",
            "- We loved Richard's studio in South End. Although small it had everything you could possibly need and appliances etc had a bit of class. We loved the area - walk to everything. A short stroll down the park path from Back Bay station and restaurants, shops etc just around the corner in any direction. Richard was very professional to deal with and communication was very good. We also loved staying in a traditional brownstone.\n",
            "- Very cute place in a secluded previously-unknown-to-me mini-neighborhood of Boston!  Leafy street of picture-perfect brownstones.  Close to Mass Ave T, Symphony Hall and great dining on Tremont.  Love that it's a little bit tucked away from the major thoroughfares in the South End, which gives it a much quieter feel than most other places you could stay.\n",

            "- The listing was sccurate - and the neighborhood had a homey charm.\n",
            "- This was a perfect place for us to stay while visiting Boston for 5 nights. We were welcomed with 2 bottles of wine that our hosts left for us and a darling, spotless studio apt. This apt is in a great neighborhood in the South End, only a few blocks from the Orange Line which takes you everywhere. We were also walking distance from almost everything including Fenway Park. I highly recommend this listing and would stay there again.\n",
            "- Great location. Mum loved the bed. Easy check-in. Richard was real helpful answering my questions. Gotta be lucky to find a parking spot tho. \n",

            "\n",
            "I enjoyed the coffee, his suggestions and the conversations and hope our paths will cross again.\n",
            "- Duane was a great host especially since my travel plans changed three times on short notice and he was willing to accomodate each time. And who can complain about a good cup of joe waiting for you in the morning.\n",

            "As long as you're not uptight and overly particular, Duane's quaint apartment will get the job done.\n",
            "- Duane's place is lovely and homey. I really enjoyed his delicious fresh roasted coffee too. Everything was very clean and tidy. Roslindale is a really cute eclectic neighborhood with a lot of great shops and restaurants. I enjoyed wandering around the neighborhood. There is also a beautiful park and arboretum at the top of the hill. Roslindale is a little bit of a trek from downtown, but I found the bus and T to be very convenient. \n",
            "- Duane was a delightful host! He was very accommodating in every sense of the word. He is quite a wonderful conversationalist, who was a real pleasure to be around. The bedroom was a perfect size and had all the fixings a traveler could ask for. I highly recommend this destination!\n",

            "- Duane has been one of the most warm and helpful hosts that I'd met.  It was very thoughtful of him to give me a lift to and from the train station on the first and last day of my stay, considering that I had a very heavy luggage. Before the trip, he already gave me tips on the best way to get around in Boston. When in Boston, I found that most of the time I was able to get to the city center very easily, as there were frequent trains and buses. Duane was very efficient in getting things done, and I enjoyed the breakfast which he prepared for me every morning - he toasted his own bread, brewed his own coffee, one of the most heavenly I had. Whatever requests that I made, he would always do his best to help. I enjoyed the evening watching movies from his Netflix account too, but most of all I enjoyed the many conversations we had during my stay. I feel that I have found a new friend on my trip to Boston. Thank you, Duane ,for making my stay a memorable one. Will certainly recommend him to anyone who like to go to Boston for a holiday or work. \n",

Knowledgable on a variety of topics, Duane is easy and enjoyable to talk to.  Since I was in the middle of an apartment hunt, he also was able to give me tips on areas to look at, which ones to avoid, and driving times to certain areas during rush hour and winter traffic.\n",

            "- This was my second stay with Duane and my experience was as great as my previous.  Whenever I stay else ware on Airbnb, I totally miss Duane's coffee and hospitality.  He's the only host I've stayed with that will get up with my early schedule and see me off in the morning.  I also love the Roku box!!...essentially it means that on-demand is at your finger tips...I was catching up on some rest and relaxation during my stay and Duane let me hog the TV the days that I was there and catch up with some (URL HIDDEN) how can I complain.  Highly recommended!\n",
            "- Duane was a very generous host, he even picked me up from the airport even though my flight arrived around midnight.

From before I came till after I had left Duane was the most helpful host I could ever imagine, making my stay in Boston so much easier and more fun. I also felt at home at his place right away, hanging in his lovely sofa everyday after a long day. Everyday would start with his friendly question if I was ready for coffee and home baked bread and I would sit and look out his window looking at the beatiful view out at Boston from his window enjoying my breakfast greatly. With Duane's interest in how I was doing and all his help we became friends and I will remember my stay at Duane's as a wonderful thing about Boston. Also don't worry about the transportation into downtown, I stayed at Duane's place for almost two weeks and went into downtown everyday and it was really no problem. One last thing.. I always felt secure in the neighborhood, it was a cozy area. I would choose Duane's place if I should ever come back to Boston and I would highly recommend Staying at Duane's to anybody going to Boston. The bottom line is that I would wish that a review like this could express how happy I was about staying at Duane's.\n",

            "- Duane was an outstanding host. I was in Boston for the Boston Marathon weekend and stayed 3 nights. He gave me a few rides to the Forest Hills station and made sure I knew the transit schedules. He took time out of his day to drive me downtown to catch the athletes bus to the start. He had coffee ready every morning. The place was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Boston area. \n",

The room's cozy, and charming.  \n",

            "- Duane's hospitality was simply incredible.  The cozy room was cute and just right for my stay.  The first night it was a little warm for my taste—I'm from Florida where air conditioning is a religion.  I mentioned it to Duane, and when I came back the next evening, there was a new fan for my room.  This is just one example of the many lovely things he did to make my stay awesome, from transit information to fetching me from the airport after my flight was massively delayed.  \n",

For me, the availability of free parking was really a huge plus, since parking in Boston can be a bear, and I liked the pleasant, quiet neighborhood. Also, I'll  add that traveling as a single woman I was totally comfortable the whole time. A thumbs-up experience!\n",
            "\n",
            "Comments: The apartment's location relative to public transit might make it a little inconvenient for tourists dependent on public transit, especially in summer heat or winter cold. For someone with a car, though, the ample free parking is a huge plus. Also, the room itself is separated from the living room -- which is always empty and peaceful during my stay -- by a heavy curtain, not a wall, which people with strong privacy issues might take note of. I felt quite comfortable, though.\n",
            "- Duane was a great host. The space was clean and sweet and Duane made me feel comfortable and welcome to move around the shared space.

            "I stayed long term - 90+ days while I did my thesis semester at Emerson College. I got my work done and was able to enjoy a bit of Roslindale Village as well.  I managed the bus/T into Boston - with a bit of planning when I stayed into the evening. I never resorted to taking a cab from the T station but did come close once or twice.\n",
            "\n",
            "All said - a couple of things that worked out okay for me but that a guest should be aware of:  What is in the photo is basically all there is to the room. I would characterize the area as a sleeping alcove since it is partitioned by a curtain not a door. There is about a one foot leeway to either side of the bed.   I put my computer on a TV tray in the arch of the alcove and that worked for me.  The living room beyond was 99% vacant so no problems there.  The only warning is that your sound/privacy is as open to the house as it is to you.  For instance: I was glad to have earplugs when a cold broke out and I wanted to escape the sound of coughing and stuffy noses.  I also tried to time personal calls and internet chats with my husband when the house was vacant.  There were times I watched TV on my Ipad to unwind - sometimes late into the night and had to remind myself to keep the volume low.\n",

            "The house is on a fairly steep hill and there are a set of steep stairs up to the apartment.  All this gives it a neat airy view of the village and downtown Boston - especially without the tree leaves.  But this also means there is a hill to walk up from the bus - thought it is a safe neighborhood. The bus right at the corner near the house has a limited schedule and does not run at night.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly - I am wheat free and didn't get to share in the daily bread and bagels but Duane did make me several breakfasts of arapas - egg/cheese in a cornmeal shell  - that were great.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the end of my stay Duane got me to the airport like a champ.  He also gave me a box to pile in all my extra books and papers I had acquired during the semester, which was a great help.\n",
            "- I don't know where to begin while writing this short review of my stay with Duane. After very friendly and timely e-mails with Duane I decided to book the \"coffee roaster's single-room\" for half a year during my study-related stay in the Boston area. \n",
            "It was a bitterly cold winter when I arrived and Duane made me feel like home from the very first day on with delicious coffee and all kinds of self-made bread variations every (!) morning and nice conversations in the evenings. After the first days, where Duane assisted me with the rental car organization and other work related preparations, we established a certain \"series-watching tradition\" and he was so kind to introduce me to some friends. This should just show you that Duane really takes care of his guests in an extraordinary and helpful way. Despite that we went to the movies a couple of times and to restaurants and groceries and, looking back, we had way too much ice cream at J.P. Licks (I won't forget the taste of the legendary Rum Raisins). As soon as the weather got better we even did a bicycling tour at Cape Cod and watched baseball games in Roslindale. \n",
            "First I was concerned if the small room allowed appropriate working on my Master's Thesis, but Duane provided a couple of small tables that made comfortable working in the TV room possible and additionally the great table in the living room was available at all times. I never had the impression that Duane felt disturbed by my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) calls or when I watched TV - he is mostly listening with headphones to the radio while working next-door.\n",
            "The location of the appartment is fantastic! You have access to several bus lines within a minute's walk range and can get into downtown Boston within approx. only 25 minutes! You can borrow Duane's Public Transportation Card, which makes commute even more comfortable. At night the view of the Boston skyline is marvelous and you can relax on the broad balcony. However, I went often to a beautiful nearby park (Roslindale Arboretum) for a walk or jogging and Duane even picked me up once when I got stuck at heavy rain due to a sudden thunderstorm. For the sake of completeness, the steep hill the house is located on and the apartment's stairs should be no unpleasant issue for an individual of good health...\n",
            "If one room is not occupied you might expect some other guests from time to time (mostly during weekends), which I appreciated as a lot of interesting discussions developed with people all over the world (Canada, France, South Africa, ...) during dinner or breakfast. Finally, the kitchen has everything you need to prepare delicious meals and the refrigerator and freezer are available for you, too.\n",
            "\n",
            "All in all, I highly recommend Duane's appartment and will keep the time I could spend together with him in and around Boston in very good memory.\n",

            "\n",
            "The area is a bit far from the centre, you need to take the subway to the last station and then a bus to get to Duane's house but the connections are good and Duane explained everything in his e mails. The house was very clean and well-ordered. It was peaceful and quiet, a very nice place to relax after spending the day downtown. The room is a bit small and is divided from the living room with a curtain, but Duane is very discreet, so I never felt lack of privacy. \n",
            "Duane knows Boston really well and was always ready to share his knowledge with me and answer any questions I had. His coffee and bread in the morning are great! You feel like being at home! \n",
            "\n",
            "On my last day I had to catch an early bus from Boston and Duane was polite enough to drive me to the subway station, which made things much easier for me.\n",
            "\n",
            "All in all, it was a very nice experience. I was travelling on my own and I felt really safe there, so I would recommend it to any woman traveller. A big \"Thank you, Duane\" for making this first airbnb experience so pleasant! \n",
            "- I was in Boston for a week and decided to stay with Duane because his room is relatively cheap. The room is small but was perfect for me; apart from the occasional big city siren you'll only hear sounds of nature (mostly chirping birds). The room is clean and has a nice bed. I slept really well. My days started perfectly because Duane makes great breakfast and coffee (I even got to taste real American pancakes!). During the day this is a quiet house with plenty of room to work.\n",
            "Roslindale is a nice little town, with good restaurants (which Duane pointed out to me or even took me to). It is very easy to get to downtown Boston from here: it costed me only 20-30 minutes by public transport. Buses leave from around the corner every 5 minutes or so. Riding the train gave great time to observe the Bostonians and felt safe. \n",
            "Being used to travel by bike I couldn't resist to rent one for a couple of days. Boston proved to be a great city for biking. I biked both into the city (very easy to follow route from Duane's house) and into nature. My favourite place in the direct neighborhood was the Arnold Arboretum, where I spent quite some time. Jamaica Plains is also a nice closeby area. \n",
            "It was nice to talk with Duane, and he was more than helpful with directions and pointing out cool things to do in Boston. He took me to a famous pizza place on the last day of my stay and dropped me of at my terminal afterwards; perfect service.\n",
            "Before staying with Duane I spent a night in one of the better reviewed Boston hostels, but I would definitely recommend to save some bucks and have a way better experience by staying at Duane's house.\n",
            "- It's the second time that I stay at Duane's house. As always, Duane provided a great experience. Every morning he set up the breakfast with fresh coffee and homemade bread. He also made delicious pancakes on Saturday. Everything was perfect. On this trip, I had a lot of luggage, and Duane kindly gave me a ride to his house. I highly recommend again Duane's house to anyone needing a nice and friendly place to stay in Boston.  \n",
            "\n",
            "- Duane was extremely gracious. I found his place well connected to downtown Boston through the metro and buses. At all the important points during my stay, Duane provided useful information about the city of Boston, transportation, and history. I always felt safe in Rosindale and surrounding neighborhoods.  There are some good restaurants and fast food places near Duane's place.\n",
            "- I stayed with Duane while on a two-month clinical rotation and his living arrangement fit my needs perfectly. Duane's place is pretty much exactly how his description on here says. He is very quick to share information about goings-on around Boston and is very knowledgeable of the surrounding area and getting around. He will bend over backwards to make your stay a welcome one and even throws in a never-ending supply of freshly baked bread to boot! The neighborhood is nice and quiet and very culturally diverse. There are a few bus routes that routinely stop by at nearby locations that can take you to the Forest Hills train stop. Duane can give you more information about the routes to and from Roslindale and may even assist you in getting around as he did with me a few times. I highly recommend at least contacting him and seeing if he's the right fit for your stay in Boston, but be quick because it appears that he has quite a popular place!\n",

            "- Duane is very kind person, he hosted me in his apartment even I came just for one day in Boston. He helped me with info about Boston, took me with his car from the subway to his house and the most important,    wrote me about a precious sd card full of photos from my trip which i lost in front of his house and sent me the files which are very important to me. I appreciate a lot what he did and I am sure he can help in  other ways the people who decide to stay in his cozy house. Highly recommended!\n",
            "- Mahtava isäntä. Hyvät keskustelut aina aamiaisella ja välillä muulloinkin. Duane osasi neuvoa reitit paikkoihin joihin olin menossa ja ehdotti muutamia kohteita, joita en edes tiennyt olevan. Hyvin pohjoismaalaisen ajattelutavan omaava amerikkalainen. Ei ollut tungettelevainen, mutta oli aina valmis auttamaan.\n",
            "Huone oli pienehkö, mutta riittävä, koska se yhdistyi suoraan olohuoneeseen, joka oli käytännössä yksityisessä käytössäni. Talo on vanha hyvällä tunnelmalla, ja näköala upea. Pysäköinti kadun varressa ilmaista, mikä on Bostonissa arvokas asia. Monikulttuurinen turvallinen naapurusto. Todella hiljainen katu. Wifi toimii. \n",
            "Itse olin liikkeellä vuokra-autolla, mutta paikallisbussi kulki ihan lähikadulla. Etelä-Boston on melko sokkeloinen, joten suosittelen autoilijalle navigaattorin käyttöä.\n",

            "- Rachel solo nos dio las llaves de la casa cuando llegamos porque ella se marchaba unos días con familiares, permanecieron allí compañeras de piso, no tuvimos sensación de sentirnos como en casa, aunque la localización era buena con respecto a la parada de metro y cercanía al parque. La habitación estaba bien, pero la limpieza de zonas comunes dejaba mucho que desear, sobre todo en baño . La limpieza no era generalizada.\n",
            "- Rachel was  an exceptionally very good host, the room was very clean and she was very welcoming, her dogs are absolutely adorable \"bronco & whiskey\" very cozy and comfortable bed along with much needed air conditioner in the room to cool us down from our visit to the downtown Boston. The trip was amazing and the experience was even better! There's good food at the corner from her house for breakfast and dinner and right across there's the train station that directly takes you to the very heart of downtown Boston! Rachel we will definitely stay with you again when we visit if you permit us to! Thank you again for making this vacation so much better and making us feel at home. \n",
            "- Quartier assez excentré mais la maison est située à quelques minutes à pieds du métro (terminus) : 20 minutes suffisent pour se rendre dans le centre de Boston. Très bon plan pour les petits budgets ! Le lit est très confortable en plus :)\n",
            "- Rachel was an excellent host we really enjoyed our stay, the bed was really comfortable and it's a good location as it's just across the road from the subway! Thanks so much\n",
            "- My girlfriend and I really enjoyed staying in Rachel's apartment.  The bed was extremely comfortable and made it hard to get up in the mornings. We had a private AC unit that made the room wonderful to sleep in. Her two dogs, Whiskey and Bronco, were very sweet, and we rarely encountered any roommates. \n",
            "\n",
            "The apartment is about 5-7 minutes from the Forest Hills Orange Line T station so getting into and around town was easy. There were plenty of food options around the station as well. You are also a short walk from the Sam Adams Brewery through some really cool neighborhoods.\n",

            "\n",
            "- This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and Rachel was an amazing host! She was very friendly and was flexible with us when we were delayed in getting in because of traffic. The room was well laid out and the bed especially comfortable. My friend and I felt right at home as she introduced us to her roommate and dogs (both who are very sweet) and even offered up her french press for us to use for coffee in the morning. We only stayed for a night, but found that the location was pretty great, close to a T stop and a quick car/Uber ride from TD Garden and downtown Boston areas. Overall, a great stay and would recommend to anyone visiting the Boston area.\n",
            "- Toni was an accommodating and friendly host who provided us with info about the area and was easily available by cell. The house was spacious and very clean. The area is quiet and is ~15min walk from the nearest T that was a quick ride into Boston city centre. I would highly recommend this for those who want to explore Boston fully without paying an excessive amount to be right in the city centre.\n",
            "- My family loved our stay in JP at Toni's lovely house. The second floor is adorable real life in Boston, and everything you could need. It's a perfect location to walk to main street in JP and beautiful pond. Our host were gracious; we appreciated her sincere efforts to share information. I would stay here again on next trip.\n",
            "- Great host with a nice space in a great location. Very close to Boston but still a quiet, quaint neighborhood. As long as your OK sharing 1 bathroom with your group, this place is lovely. \n",

            "Thanks again.\n",
            "- Victor's place  well designed. The space is great for one person and is a little tight for two people, but its no problem if you are close with the other person. My favorite snacks and drinks were ready when I arrived as well as plenty of water. Great space for the price and you can't beat that its a 2 minute walk from the T drop off/ pick up station.\n",
            "- Victor was very attentive, flexible and welcoming. I truly appreciated his availability to show the apt prior to my mother arriving and flexibility in changing the dates to meet our needs. He had fruit and beverages available as a welcome gift. There was an issue with the plumbing, which was efficiently dealt with and Victor quickly offered a partial refund for the inconvenience of work men in the apt to fix the issue. The place itself is clean, warm and very accessible to many restaurants, supermarkets, transportation. The only minor annoyances were the noise level of at night of people coming in and out of the building (easily dealt with using ear plugs) and the key when entering the building would sometimes require several minutes to get it to open. Otherwise, wonderful stay. \n",
            "- Close to the T and everything Boston has to offer!Vic is a great host, making sure we had personalized drinks and snacks and that we we felt comfortable in his space :) we had a fantastic stay!!! Bed is very comfy too! \n",
            "- VJ's place was the perfect place for us. We weren't spending a bunch of time in, and it was a great location to grab an Uber or the T just steps away.\n",
            "\n",
            "VJ was awesome! I've been doing Airbnb for a long time, and he's been one of the best hosts so far. The place is exactly as it looks in the pics. It's super efficient with space and quirky.\n",
            "\n",
            "One thing to note is the bathroom is super small. It was totally perfect for my partner and I, but I would definitely say, if you aren't already, be prepared to get very comfortable with the other person. And finally, I would mention that the building is old, and to not be put off by the entrance, which could definitely use some repair, and a good cleaning. It is not at all representative of VJ's place.\n",
            "\n",
            "We'd definitely recommend VJ's and stay again.\n",
            "- Superb hostess. Excellent location. Very homey apartment in a safe neighborhood with a pond nearby. Shops/restaurants within healthy walking distance. Concerns for me were minor. There was no elevator to the second floor and walls were a bit thin, otherwise I certainly recommend Jane's residence.\n",

            "The apartment was good, but under modern I mean something else ! \n",
            "It was reasonably cleaned !\n",

            "Jane is a very friendly and nice person!\n",

            "- Three of us stayed at Jane's place for 3 days in April 2013.  We had plenty of space and felt very safe the whole time there.  The train station was within walking distance, but it was a 35-45 minute trip to downtown. Jane was such a gracious hostess and made sure we had everything we needed. \n",
            "- Great location. Spacy apartment that was everything but modern. Some essentials were missing: no coffee maker, no microwave, no pots, and the TV didn't work. Also, we had to clean some of  the dishes before we used them for the first time. If you are only looking for a place to sleep and not much luxury the apartment will do.\n",
            "- Pleasure renting this 2 bedroom from Jane. She was very friendly and always there when we had questions. Also very convenient that she lives in the same building in-case you have any emergency like locking yourself out, etc.\n",

The kitchen has all the equipment you need for cooking, breakfast etc. There is guest parking available up to 4 days and Jane will give you the sticker for you car. The 'Boston College' T station is approx. a 10 min walk away and you can use a shortcut there. From here it will take you at least 30-40 mins to downtown! So plan in some more time. The apartment lies within a larger housing complex and is very quiet which is nice. In the morning you will hear the upstairs neighbors walking around. The apartment could have been a tiny bit tidier. \n",
            "- I stayed a few days and although it is completely out of town, there is a tramway that takes you there in 30 minutes. Nights where calm and the appartment clean although pretty used.\n",
            "- Jane's apartment was a great fit for myself, my husband and our three children. It's relatively clean and spacious enough. The kitchen is pretty small, but we never used it to make any meals so it was fine for us. Jane let us use her laundry card, which was super gracious of her. Jane was a great host and super easy to get ahold of.\n",
            "- The apartment is located in a nice lakeside residential area also near the golf course. The apartment is conveniently located to BC and the T.  It was a pleasant 7 minute  walk to the T. There is a short cut to take which is easy to find in the day, Jane was helpful with pointing it out.  I suggest taking a cab from the BC stop,  if traveling at night, it costs less than $7. Jane and her husband were both helpful at check in/out. I arrived before 8am, and they were able to accommodated my check in time\n",

            "From the pictures I was expecting the wonderful decor and clean space but couldn't have predicted her hospitality. My sister had to take over communication with Jane towards the end as my work schedule had me tied up cross country; our parents flights were  delayed multiple times and we were in and out of the apartment multiple times. Through all this Jane remained courteous and understanding and put my parents at ease which meant the world.\n",

It is definitely spacious and cozy enough for three adults (two friends and myself were running races around the Boston College area for a weekend) whose main mission is to run, eat, rest and repeat. The kitchen is equipped with necessary utensils for serving meals - we didn't cook but saw basic spices and herbs on the shelves. Jane replies to emails, calls and texts promptly and was very helpful with information regarding the area. Highly recommended!\n",
            "- This was my first time using Airbnb. My family (4 total) and I enjoyed staying at this apartment. The neighborhood is quiet, clean, well-manicured! The apartment is beautiful, very clean with lots of space and very comfortable beds & a sofa bed. Jane is very warm and waited to receive us when we arrived. She also checked in with us everyday to ensure we were enjoying our stay in Boston. When our travel plans changed, she let our mom stay with us for a complimentary night! I'm very glad we chose to stay here. We now prefer staying at an apartment rather than a hotel! Thank you very much Jane! I'll definitely recommend this listing to others.\n",
            "- We had a great time visiting Boston.  Jane was very helpful and kind.  We liked the roomy apartment and it worked well for our needs.

            "When I researched a place for the 4th of July weekend, I saw this for $100 (or as AirBnB stated \"from $100\") which I didn't realize would turn into $185 per night by the time all the extra fees were heaped on.  At $100 to $125 or so this would have been fine.  When I saw the actual fees, I should have kept looking. In any event, AirBnB should be more transparent about fees.\n",

Of several Airbnb apartments where we have stayed, Jane's place was one of the most complete and best appointed with everything we needed.  Very spacious rooms and nice balcony patio.  Complex is quiet and the surrounding neighborhood is very nice.  Short (pretty) walk to Boston College and the T stop.   We would definitely stay here again.\n",
            "- Lovely apartment with everything we needed for a very enjoyable visit to Boston. Great location, close to BC and a short walk to public transport. The neighbourhood is very pleasant and quiet. Jane is so friendly and helpful. She made us feel so welcome and even drove us to the local supermarket on our first night as we were staying for two weeks and needed to stock up with food etc. All in all we would highly recommend this property.\n",

The unit is furnished with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The WiFi worked very well. The building is a little old and noisy. You can hear residents in units above and below converse and walk around. Parking was a tad inconvenient.\n",
            "- Our stay in Jane's condo was a great experience.  The beds were comfortable and there was access to a balcony from both bedrooms and the living room.  It was very close to Boston College and Boston University and the neighborhood was quiet and safe.  \n",

However, Jane does have 2 very nice large modern fans that we placed in each room that worked fine in keeping us cool. \n",

The location is in a nice neighborhood right next to Boston College. Very residential and far from the city. Public transportation is about less than mile walking. Can be difficult if you travel with with the elderly.  We had a good stay and Jane had been great and responsive since we booked the apartment. Great internet access is a plus too! \n",
            "- Jane was a brilliant host from start to finish she was always there to help if we had any questions. She was very accommodating. The apartment itself was very clean and spacious. It was also in an appropriate location as we were only a ten minute walk from the metro into the city. Overall we throughly enjoyed our experience and would highly recommend it.\n",

            " The bedrooms and living room all opened onto the deck, which was nice. Everything was just as represented on the Airbnb site. The kitchen was small, but provided all we needed. The living area was large enough for all of us to relax comfortably. \n",

            "- The listing description was accurate and the place was exactly as expected.  Nice plus was the availability of grills on the third floor.  Only marked as 3 stars because 1) we had a day without electricity in the building and the next day there was no water, followed by very dirty hot water that had to be run out for 45 minutes or more.  Not the host fault, but the building.  I would not expect others to have the same problems.\n",
            "- A hidden gem! Hongjin was a lovely host, and it was a pleasure staying with her. The downstairs room was cool in the humid weather and the house in a quaint, safe neighbourhood. Would love to stay with/host Hongjin again\n",
            "- Our stay was very pleasant it was a short one so we didnt mind about the room having enough light or small details like that. The room was clean and we had a separate bathroom for our use only. Hongjhin was very responsive and helpful too :)\n",
            "- The apartment was very comfortable and clean.  My husband and I would absolutely stay again!\n",
            "\n",
            "- Definitely not fit for 3 people to stay long term. Overall a decent place to stay for a short period of time and the photos are accurate. \n",
            "- In the beginning we run into problems in finding the keys and the apartment. Overall, the apartment was comfortable and pretty clean. The apartment is located on the 4th floor and there are no elevator \n",
            "- The host responded fairly quickly to every inquiry that I had.  I particularly liked the location, just a one-minute walk to the train.  If you are on a budget travelling around Boston, I would recommend staying at this place to save money on a rental car.\n",
            "- Good size room with hot water shower near to train station. A bit hot in the summer since it is on the top floor of a walk up apartment. Our experience could have been a lot better if the host could be more responsive and provide clearer instruction to find the key to the apartment.\n",
            "- It was perfect for our one night stay. good space, nice location. Host kept great contact with us and answered every question we had.\n",
            "- We had a great time staying here! The only drawback is the parking situation. It's not easy. Thankfully Uber and Lyft are always around. The place was nice and exactly what we needed for our two days. Cheers!\n",
            "- Olechka  helped  to  keep  our  luggage  while  we  were  on  tour\n",
            "- The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- Great place, similar system to a hotel. Definitely recommending this place for people in need of a space. The wifi never ended working for me, so I hope they can fix it for next time.\n",
            "- I rented this small studio for a friend visiting me in Boston. The studio was just perfect: simple and clean, in the middle of the most amazing and elegant neighborhood of Boston. The place is just for a person and it has all you need for a short vacation in Boston. The host was professional and he always replied to my requests and questions. \n",
            "- The studio is exactly as described: a nice, clean place to stay while in town.  Its also in a great neighborhood, couldn't ask for anything else.  I would definitely stay there again.  \n",
            "- This studio was perfect for my business trip. It is on a nice quiet street just steps to newbury for all of your shopping and dining needs. Would probably be too small for more than one, but was clean and quiet. Easy picking up the keys, wifi worked great, no complaints!\n",
            "- Similar to a motel setup, reasonable room at a reasonable price. Getting the key 2 blocks away in light drizzle with luggage was little inconvenient for me.\n",

            "-the sheets need replacement. They are old. \n",
            "-same goes for the pillows. They are terribly cheap. \n",
            "- Very easy to work with and everything was as advertised.  Note that if you think you can stay in downtown Boston for $89 you aren't looking for 5-star accommodations.  Bernie's place worked well for me and I'd stay there again, but feel it appropriate to add some details to the description.  This is for one person, or two that need little room and have no modesty issues.  $89/nt should be the top price.  The furniture and condition is serviceable, nothing more, and it's clean.  The shower is small and the stall is about 18\" above the floor - you step up into it and the step down would present a challenge to a person with any limitations on mobility.  The apartment is street level next to the front entry to this brownstone, so there is some noise, but the residents are not a rowdy bunch.   The key is at the office a couple hundred yards away and the T is about 6 blocks away, so a cab is a good idea in poor weather.\n",
            "- I thought the place was great! Really easy to find and in an awesome location! The cost was fair although the place was a bit dirty.\n",

            "\n",
            "Please note the other reviews regarding the noise from other people who live in the building.  You can literally feel their foot steps as they walk by and haul their bags up the stairs.  Also, when the mailman slams the mailboxes shut as they are on the other side of the bed (loud noise made me jump).\n",
            "\n",
            "Last note: there is no heating.  There is a hot water pipe that goes from floor to ceiling in one if the corners, but it was sufficient to overpower the draft coming in around the window-style air conditioner.\n",
            "\n",
            "The place has clean sheets and towels as well as decent Wi-Fi.  Other than that, it was quite run down (mold in the shower door, missing on old dresser, cracks in the door jamb that you can see through, long blonde hair everywhere).\n",

            "The place is, surely, nothing fancy, but was perfect for my needs, as I was out and about most of the time. Internet was fine, TV also.\n",
            "Fantastic, safe location in a great neighborhood. I would definitely return.\n",
            "- Great location in Back Bay. It makes it easy to see the main sites in Boston and Cambridge. The place is as advertised. The only thing to be aware of is noise. This unit is beside the main entrance of the building and the walls don't offer much of a sound barrier. I'm a fairly deep sleeper but I was awoken both mornings I was there by the sound of the front door closing as people left the building. That said, at this price point (low) in this location (great), I'd still recommend the place to a single traveler that's looking for a no-frills option. \n",

            "There were however a few drawbacks.  First, this place is street level and, although the street is quiet, it is very loud when people enter and leave the building.  The stairs go right over the room and it literally sounds like thunder when people climb them.  For sensitive sleepers, take caution.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "There were a couple of other minor issues, two of which admittedly, had I brought up with the host would have been rectified.  First, the lock was broken and hard to use.  Second, the internet was very very slow - my cellular data was faster.  Third, parking in the Back Bay is VERY EXPENSIVE, like 30 to 40USD for a 24 hour period.  Some hosts will provide guest residential parking permits, this is something to take into consideration when booking, even if it means a more expensive room tariff.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Location. Location. Location. This room is in a great location in the Back Bay neighborhood. A quick walk to shops, restaurants, the Hynes Convention Center and the Cheers Bar!  It is, as advertised, a very small room--but great for one person. And Bernie was great to rent from.\n",
            "- This studio apartment worked well for a quick stay in Boston.   It was very easy to pick up the key (the office is a few blocks down the street) and the staff was very accommodating (I arrived early and was able to store my luggage for the entire day until I was done with a conference).  The apartment itself is quite basic but had hot water and central heating - this was key as the outside temperature was in the 20's.  It was perfect for one person and is located within walking distance to many restaurants, cafes, shops, and museums.\n",
            "- I enjoyed staying in this small studio.  There is not much to say.  The listing description is accurate, the neighborhood is charming.  The host answered my queries promptly.  I recommend it and hope to book it again when I will be back to Boston.\n",
            "- The description was for a very small studio.  With a studio I expected a cook stove, toaster, maybe a kitchen sink, and a fork, knife and a spoon.  None of those were included.  The description would  be more accurate stating a small room with 3/4 bath and a microwave and refrigerator.  Then the buyer would clearly know what they are purchasing.\n",
            "- Perferct small apartment for one person. Everything one needs, including wireless internet. No kitchen, but microwave present. Quiet building on beautiful street, walking distance to Prudential Center, Newbury Street, and other Backbay attractions. Train station 10-15 minute walk. Subways 5-10 minute walk. Effortless arrival and departure. Bernie is a great host. I will stay here again when visiting this part of Boston.\n",
            "- Great location!! Walkable!  The place is small but the space is very usable.  Comfortable to sleep, eat and use the bathroom/shower.  The heat in the building went off at night (at about 9) and didn't come on till after 7 AM.  I believe this is not controlled by the host, but it was cold at night  (It was under 30 degrees F outside and snowy! ) I am guessing that Bernie would have been happy to supply an additional blanket had I asked.  He was responsive in general and answered e-mails in good time.  In the dead of winter, picking up the key could be inconvenient, but all in all, this apartment was a great deal, a big bargain, and was more than adequate, right in the middle of the city!  I would definitely stay here again!  Thanks!!    \n",
            "- The place was as advertised. It was very small, however, I didn't go to Boston to just sit inside all day. It was perfect for me. So if you don't plan on staying inside, this is the place for you. With in walking to some where as far as harpoon brewery but an even closer walk to some where like Fenway. It's in a great location. My only complaint is there is no way to control the temperature and the windows needed something to hold them up bc it got way to hot at night.\n",

My privacy was respected, and the interaction with Bernie was smooth through the app. I really enjoyed my stay at Boston.\n",

            "- I did not Bernie himself but we kept in touch through e-mail. The arrangements for check in and out went well. As the studio is associated with the Beacon St Guest House just down the road, I called in there first. On my last day, as my flight was late at night, I checked out early but left my luggage at the Guest House for the day. The staff at the Guest House were very helpful and obliging.\n",
            "The studio is billed as 'very small' but I found it quite alright - I certainly did not find it cramped or claustrophobic. There is a big window - adequately screened from the road by plants.  I appreciated the bathroom and the airconditioning. The room is very quiet. The microwave and iron+ironing board also came in useful. The wifi is fast too.\n",
            "Excellent location - nice surroundings - about 10 minutes walk to Copley Station and the Back Bay stop for the bus to Logan airport outside the Hynes convention centre. Within about 5-10 minutes walk lots of restaurants, shops and cafes along Newbury Street. In the other direction, one can easily get to the banks of the Charles River - pleasant to walk in the early morning or evening.\n",

It was very difficult to contact him about this - I went to the guest house to talk to him, but they had never heard of him. I tried to call him on his mobile phone, but that only got me through to the guest house. I had begun to wonder if he was a real person. I eventually was able to contact him and he said that the cleaners had been the day before, but he had not checked. They came again quite quickly, but there was still long, dark hair on the floor and again the carpet had not been vacuumed.\n",

The location is superb, next to the river and next to the center, in a quiet road. I arrived late and had to pick up the key from down the road, from the guest house. It is a short walk, but if you're carrying luggage and come by taxi I would advice to ask the taxi to take you there first, and maybe even wait for you and take you to the other place, especially if the luggage doesn't have wheels.\n",

Steve at the guest house was really helpful in answering my enquiries and arranging check out. Had a nice stay in Boston \n",
            "- The keys were easy to pick up from down the street and the location of the apartment was ideal, central to Boston's main attractions. To me, it's important to point out that this apartment may not be for you if you are a bit more particular about the details of your temporary home. Everything in the apartment appears to be quite old and/or of low quality (i.e. a chair that feels like it's about to fall apart, a comforter that's noticeably worn, and sheets/pillows that are low-quality). I genuinely didn't mind any of these things given the low cost of the rental, but I'd like to warn inquirers because I know some people who would've been extremely uncomfortable staying at this apartment. If these types of details mean a lot to you and you can afford a slightly more expensive rental, you should probably stay away. Although I don't regret my decision, I'm disappointed that it seems like the owner doesn't believe in making small investments in the property to improve guests' experiences. It would cost less than $500 to make significant improvements which would go a long way for guests.\n",

            "- I enjoyed by stay at Bernie's studio.  Just as stated, it is a small studio really only suitable for one. Two individuals would fit but a little cramped.  As a single traveler it was perfect size for me and I didn't plan to spend lots of time inside.  The location is great! Walking distance to great selection of shopping and restaurants and to public transportation.  If you looking for shiny and new, this may not be the place for you.   If you are elderly or have accessibility issues be warned that there are several steps into the building (as lots of places in Boston do) and there is a funky step up into the shower.\n",
            "- The studio is small, but very well located in the lovely Back Bay. It was convenient and comfortable. As others have mentioned, it is as advertised and probably best for one person who is looking to get out and explore Boston. I look forward to my next stay. Communication with Bernie was easy, and when at the last minute I needed a late Check out - Bernie was able to accommodate me right away.\n",
            "- The studio is exactly as advertisd and it was just perfect for me - great location in Back Bay and only half an hour walking distance from MIT. It has all essentials that are needed. Just two minor issues: as it is an old house and the apartment is right next to the entrance, it sounds as if people are standing right next to your bed when they are entering or leaving the building; and I couldn't find anything to turn up the heating systems and felt a little cold most of the time (but I usually need it warmer than most people, so others shouldn't have much trouble with that). Would definitely stay there again next time!\n",
            "- The studio is definitely small, but clean and comfortable with nice add-ons, especially considering the size, including fridge, microwave, internet, and TV. The location is great and I would be happy to stay there again. Make sure to email/call ahead of time, since you may need to pick up your keys a couple of blocks away.\n",
            "- Decent small studio, exactly as described. Close to Hynes Convention Center, MIT and Copley. Keys are collected and dropped off two blocks away. Bernie's response is prompt and professional. \n",
            "- Really nice location and convenient, clean, and cozy. For a single person stay in Backbay, this is the perfect choice. \n",
            "- As other reviews have mentioned, this unit is associated with a local guest house (where you check in/out). I never actually met Bernie, but he was prompt in email communication. Unit is small, and not the most fancy, but certainly comfortable enough for a short stay. It's more affordable than a hotel, and conveniently located for access to public transportation and interesting things in the city. \n",
            "- The room is small as accurately described in the listing. the neighborhood (Brownstones) is killer.  5 minute stroll to shops and food. i had a great stay. thanks Bernie\n",
            "- It's accurate that the place is very small essentially a single room with a very small shower room off one end but it fitted my needs well. It had basic appliances fridge microwave coffee machine enough to have some flexibility but not a full kitchen. It's in a great location in Back Bay within easy walking distance of the T with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby and an easy stroll out to the river. I enjoyed my stay.\n",
            "- The studio was a described in the listing and it is located in a very nice neighborhood in Boston. Check-in and check-out was smooth and host was willing to accommodate my schedule for the stay.\n",
            "- The listing describes the apartment very accurately. The unit is small, but quite workable. The main reason to stay here is the neighborhood! It was absolutely adorable and tons of shopping and restaurants near by! Obviously you get what you pay for here, and while the unit has plenty of towels, cable TV, and internet, the connection is slow and the construction/furniture is a bit rickety. I also didn't notice if this was mentioned in the description but the unit is on the 1st floor with the large windows looking out to the street. There is a large hedge in front of the window for some privacy, but it still made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Overall quite satisfied with this unit though and the location is great.\n",
            "- A little confusing on how to get the keys, apartment is enough, and location is perfect.\n",
            "- Accurate description - this is a smaller studio apartment, situated in a fantastic location minutes walk from the city hubs.  Grocery store is nearby, as are several excellent restaurants. Quiet area with minimal traffic so a restful nights sleep.  \n",
            "- A second great stay - very convenient location!\n",
            "- This little apartment was a good spot for my busy work travel in Back Bay. Bernie was responsive and easy to deal with. Note: the bathroom doesn't have a real door, so better for 1 guest or 2 very close guests. \n",
            "- The listing descriptions accurate and the host was accommodating to last minute changes of my itinerary. I would gladly stay at this location again. \n",
            "- The apartment was pretty close to \"as advertised.\" Very small, but clean and a good location. The TV was a little tough to figure out -- would have been nice to have brief instructions re which remote to use.  It was affordable during a busy week in Boston, so the only real feedback I have is that my experience would have been greatly improved by softer sheets. I don't think the sheets were old or cheap, just really scratchy. :) Thanks Bernie! You were very nice and responsive when I emailed. \n",
            "- Todo es como describe el aviso. El check-in fue muy fácil. El apartamento está muy bien ubicado. Lo único que debe mejorar es la señal del WiFi, es muy débil.\n",
            "- For budget stays close to Copley, this was a good choice.  It's a bit of a walk if you're carrying bags, especially if you need to pick up the keys, but otherwise the studio was definitely convenient, the space is perfect for one person, and I appreciated the free wifi.  It could use a little freshening up, but it worked for my little business trip. Thanks, Bernie!\n",
            "- Apartment exactly as described.  Beautiful building and the neighborhood is amazing!\n",
            "Quiet, too. \n",
            "I would stay here again.\n",
            "Perfect for business trips due to convenience of the area, Walgreens, CVS, Trader Joes-all a few blocks away.\n",
            "There is a Sweetgreens, too! \n",
            "\n",
            "- Good location for conference at the Sheraton in Boston.  The place looks a lot better than the photos provided on airbnb :)\n",
            "- This studio is in a great neighborhood. Worked out really well for me with the local shopping and access to the T line so I could get over to the financial district for work. Bernie was very responsive to questions and providing details as to the key pickup/drop off\n",
            "- Gustavo is a great guest. He is very kind and allways disposed to help with recommendations about places to visit or restaurants. The place is well located and the room is comfortable. I will recommend anyone to stay at his place\n",
            "- Gustavo was great. Due to my schedule I was always in and out of the room at odd hours but Gustavo was very accommodating and  prompt in responding to emails as well as anticipating what I may need. The room was very nice, and the location was equally as so. You are about a 5 minute or less cab ride from the city itself. \n",
            "- Gustavo was a gracious & thoughtful host. He was happy to give dining recommendations, was timely responding to messages, & kindly helped us w/ public transportation questions. The room was quite comfortable & really is the perfect location for a stay in Boston near the heart of the city. We would most definitely stay again!!\n",
            "- Upon arrival, we were greeted by Gustavo who was very friendly and helpful. The accomodation was great. Large room in a very elegant home in a wonderful location. Just 10 minutes walk to downtown, we could not have asked for a better location. The continental breakfast of freshly baked scones (biscuits) was very welcome. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Boston!\n",
            "- He followed up multiple times to make sure I had all the info I needed. He responded very quickly and left an envelope with all other info I'd need while I was there on the desk in my room. He's very willing to help you out in any way he can. I ran into him one time and he was very nice.\n",
            "- Gustavo's house was really comfy, clean and tidy. Gustavo was really helpful on arrival, with eating suggestions for the evening, and although I didn't see him till I left, it was a very pleasant stay. The house is ideally located for everything in the city, and I was able to walk all around. If I come back to Boston, I'd definitely consider staying again. \n",
            "- Although Gustavo and I missed each other having varying schedules, he was super flexible, helped me out with an ironing board when I needed it in a pinch, and definitely made me feel welcome. I'd highly recommend staying here. The place itself is awesome, lots of colonial character, really makes you feel like you've entered a portal into the 18th century. \n",
            "- Perfect location in the middle of Boston and a lovely room. Gustavo is a great host - there only when you need him and a helpful source of useful information. \n",
            "- Our visit to Boston included a very nice, large clean room.  We shared a bathroom with the resident across the hall but that did not cause any problems whatsoever.  We never even saw each other. The sounds of the city were pretty quiet.  Gustavo, the owner, greeted us soon after we arrived and provided us with tips for local meals and gave us some historical background about the area. We kept in touch via texting and email as needed and Gustavo was always available if we had questions. Breakfast was self serve in the upstairs kitchen which was fully stocked.  We also had access to the living room area. This area of Boston was very convenient for us and the T stop was a few minutes walk.  We would be happy to return in the future.  \n",
            "Gustavo kept our luggage safe for us on the day of our departure and we were able to come back and retrieve it with ease on our own time schedule.  There is no television, (if that is an issue for you. It wasn't for us).\n",
            "Don't pass up this spot if you are traveling to Beantown and want to feel like you belong here.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Todo fue perfecto, la descripción se corresponde con el lugar. \n",
            "Zona tranquila; muy cerca del centro caminando a menos de 5 minutos linea naranja metro.\n",
            "El desayuno correcto. \n",
            "Gustavo te da sugerencias y se mantiene presente sin agobiarte y dándote libertad y flexibilidad.\n",
            "- I have only great things to say about my stay at Gustavo's: 1-ideal central location, 2- nice, comfortable accommodation, 3-very friendly and helpful host. I was in Boston for the coldest weekend of the year, so it was so great that everything was within 1-3 blocks or 2-5 mins walking (bars, restaurants, theaters). Room was professionally clean but felt very homey. We met Gustavo twice and he gave good recommendations for nearby hot spots. Gustavo was also very responsive. I texted him a 10pm for a request and he replied right away.  Oh did I mention how nice it is to wake up with a continental breakfast prepared (coffee!) without having to venture out in the cold? Def recommend. \n",
            "- Gustavo's Inn was a wonderful place to stay. The location is great and very close to the T, restaurants and shops. Very happy we booked here and I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Boston. Gustavo was a great host and made us feel at home and comfortable and was very knowledgeable about the history of the house and the area and gave us recommendations of restaurants. \n",
            "- The room was clean, welcoming and in a house full of character. Gustavo was an excellent host that made us feel very welcome and was always helpful. I would strongly recommend this listing to anybody hoping to see Boston. Very close to a T station and you can be downtown in no time at all. A great spot!\n",
            "- Gustavo was very helpful giving us the history of his beautiful Victorian home & area and recommending sights to see. Provided us a list of great restaurants to try. Great location near Chinatown, theatre district, back bay train station and Boston Commons. The foam bed was fabulous and the place was very quiet! Nice to have a common living room and kitchen and continental breakfast. \n",
            "- Gustavo was an excellent host! He helped us carry our bags up and down the stairs, and laid out breakfast for us each morning! The room was clean and beautiful. The neighborhood was lovely- it felt like we were transported back in time when we walked down the street! \n",
            "- This was my first time using Airbnb and Gustavo was the perfect host! He was able to accommodate us after we couldn't make the first night. Communication with him was super easy and quick! The room was perfect,  very comfortable, cute and clean. The inn itself is ideally located in an amazing part of Boston, full of history and charm, and in walking distance of the theatre district, Chinatown and the Boston commons! Would love to stay there again!\n",
            "- This was a wonderful place! Location was perfect, truly in the heart of Boston with 5 min walk to the Boston Common. Gustavo was easy to communicate with and made me feel welcome showing me around this narrow 4 story home reflecting the neighborhood's history and charm. My room was very comfortable with a clean bath in the hallway. This was my first time renting a room only. I also enjoyed having coffee and meeting other guests in the kitchen on the 4th floor. Highly recommended place!\n",
            "- Good place -- clean, very convenient location, nice people. Best if you don't mind stairs, since this is a Bay Village townhouse with four floors and you'll need to go up and down to get in/out and reach breakfast, which is on the top floor. Ask for the room with the private bath.\n",
            "- Gustavo is very nice and the house is in a great location. He provides a lovely continental breakfast if you reserve in advance. The shared bathroom is very convenient because there is a bathroom every floor, so you will share it with few people actually. The only inconvenient thing is the laundry, we have to go to the public laundry room across the street.\n",
            "- Gustavo was very welcoming and accommodating.  The room, and the entire setting, was very nice, clean and quiet.  Can't recommend enough.\n",
            "- Gustavo's home is located in close proximity to everything you could want to see in Boston. He was available when we had questions and offered great suggestions about what to experience in the area. We appreciated the breakfast and coffee in the morning. \n",
            "- This was a great place to stay within walking distance to a lot of great places in Boston. Gustavo was a great host, willing to help with any need. \n",
            "- My host was warm and inviting and covered everything! He waited up for me as my flight was delayed and helped me with my bags. The location was absolutely perfect!!!! And it was very clean I would stay there again for sure! \n",
            "- Gustavo was well organized & we understood the details for getting to the location & gaining access to our room! Thanks, Gustavo! It was an attractive, welcoming place! And very close to our meetings in Copley Square!\n",
            "- Gustavo was an excellent host. From our arrival to our departure he was very accommodating with our luggage. He was also very helpful in finding us things to do and places to eat. Thank you!\n",
            "- This was a great location and within walking distance of many of the things we wanted to see. We enjoyed visiting with Gustavo at breakfast our first morning there. Gustavo was also very good at communicating information we needed for our arrival and responded quickly and positively to any questions or requests we had.\n",

            "Our bed was comfortable with nice linens and elegant decor.\n",
            "- What a beautiful & historic inn, and such a great neighborhood! This Bay Village neighborhood is perfectly located between Back Bay and Downtown, with a Charlie/Metro stop just minutes away.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Gustavo has a lovely 1800s brick house and his upgrades make it a great place to stay for modern travelers. Key pickup & dropoff was a breeze, as was wifi access and kitchen access. His top floor kitchen & sitting room were a nice perk! AC was great for the high 90s heat and high humidity of Boston. \n",
            "\n",
            "While it lists as a \"private room\" this felt closer to an inn than a house. We had direct access to the bathroom outside our door and with a full bathroom on all three guest floors, there was never a wait for toilet or shower. \n",
            "\n",
            "I highly recommend Gustavo and his Bay Village Inn! He's an accommodating and kind host, and his effort shows in the quality of experience! 6 Stars! \n",
            "- Gustavo's place at 11 Fayette was ideal -- a lovely room in the perfect location. Almost felt as though we were in Paris! We were comfortable walking everywhere. It was close to everything but located on a quiet, sweet street. Gustavo was responsive to our questions and needs. \n",
            "- The room was what was depicted and more. Loved the decoration. It had a very nice, vintage, feel to it. Lots of travel books on the shelf to read. Bathroom was very clean, and everything in the house was very organized. The location is pretty much as good as you can get. Walk-able to distance to all the great sites, and close to subway lines. Gustavo was very thorough in explaining where to go, and we hit up many of the places he recommended. You can tell that he knows, and love Boston very well. Will definitely recommend!\n",
            "- Hamed's apartment was perfect, tastefully furnished in an ideal location - Newbury St! We even walked to the Fenwall Park to watch a baseball match. Close to the \"T\" Bostons public transport, numerous restaurants and shopping and extremely quite. Bonus of a doorman for security!\n",

            "\n",
            "- I was very impressed.  Dealing with Hamed was a real pleasure.  He did everything he said he would.  The night before we left I got a text checking in just to see how everything was and that was it.  Apartment was beautiful, roomy and very well stocked.  It was also convenient to everything.  I think everyone that stayed will go back next time they are in Boston.  Thanks so much for a fabulous weekend.\n",
            "- The experience was great! The location is excellent near the busy Fenway, beautiful parks and trendy Newbury Street, in the heart of Back Bay. Everything is at walking distance! \n",
            "\n",
            "The apartment is spacious, bright and has everything to make the experience enjoyable. While there was a minor issue at the beginning of our stay, Hamed was concerned and diligent to resolve it. 100% recommended.\n",
            "- The host was great as was very responsive and also let us leave our luggage in the unit until 3PM on the day of checkout as we had a late flight out on the final day.  The host checked in via text message to make sure everything was ok and we didn't need anything.  As for the unit, it was very clean and well maintained.  There were towels waiting for us when we got there.  The only con to our group was the beds were very hard in which some people like that, we all prefer much less firm beds.  The master bedroom receives a lot of light in the bedroom in the mornings due to light colored blinds so if you are affected by this bring a sleeping mask.  The unit was great and would stay here again if make it back to boston.  Location was perfect walking distance to Fenway, great restaurants, and shopping.  The North End was also within walking distance (approx 40 min) on a nice day.\n",
            "- The spacious apartment is well appointed, and in a great location! On a practical basis, a number of supermarkets within walking distance allowed us to get the necessary supplies. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby as well. It was very comfortable too for when the family felt like staying in and watching a movie. Not to mention that Hamed is a very gracious and accommodating host! As others have said, he followed up to make sure everything was OK soon after we had checked in.\n",
            "- We had a wonderful time! Great location, beautiful views from the apartment. We all slept well. The kitchen was well stocked with tools and we found them easily. Hamed was quick to respond and made checking in and out very easy\n",
            "- We are a family of 5 and were very comfortable at Hamed's listing.  The apt. is beautiful and very well situated to access all the touristic sites.  Very close to the subway, Fenway Park as well as all the wonderful shops and restaurants in the Back Bay area.  Hamed made it very easy to check in/out.  Thank you for an easy, relaxing, fun stay.\n",
            "- We had a great week in this appartment. Location is just perfect with everything the city and Newbury street in particular has to offer.  The appartment was light and spacious, everything worked, good place to relax. Hamed, the owner, responded quickly, helpful and friendly. Great place to stay. \n",
            "- We had a great time at Hamed's place - the apartment was awesome inside, much bigger than I thought it would be; we could walk more or less everywhere we wanted to go - Fenway Park was very close; and Hamed was prompt and accommodating when we contacted him. Strongly recommend!\n",
            "- Hamed was a great host. He stayed in contact, making sure I got checked in ok and that everything was as expected. The apartment is in a fantastic location, convenient to the T and in a great section of Newbury Street with lots of shops and such within easy walking distance. \n",
            "- First of all, the unit is absolutely gorgeous. When we walked in we could see all the across the unit to the floor to ceiling windows with a beautiful view of downtown Boston. There are dark hardwood floors throughout. It is very contemporary, which we look for whenever we travel. The building is at the west end of Back Bay so you are within easy walking distance of Fenway, as well as all the shopping and dining in Back Bay. There is a subway stop in the bottom of the building so it's super convenient to travel around Boston. Both bedrooms have queen size beds. We made ourselves right at home using the things in the kitchen and watching TV. The guest bedroom has no bedroom window. I didn't mind this as I like it as dark as possible when I sleep, but I didn't want to spend any time in there during the day. The living room was so comfortable, I didn't want to be in there anyway. Both bathrooms are roomy and the guest bathroom is right across the hall from the guest bedroom while the master bedroom has it's own bathroom. There is a washer & dryer in the unit. There is a secure entryway with concierge. We never asked for advice but most of them were very friendly. Hamed was in contact with us throughout our stay, making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again. We have absolutely no complaints and felt like this checked all of the boxes in what we look for in a vacation home. \n",
            "- We had a last minute business trip to book and Hamed could not have been more accommodating. He hustled to make sure the apt. was cleaned and ready in time on a very short turnaround. He checked in with us every step of the way to make sure we were comfortable and happy. The whole process was super easy! The apartment itself, WOW. VERY spacious, clean, comfortable,modern,  well equipped and the location was incredible. The layout was perfect for 2 people with ample private space for each of us. All around a fantastic apt. and location! I plan to stay here again and recommend it for both business and personal travel to Boston.\n",
            "- This apartment was amazing. The size was unbelievable and the finishes are very nice. The Back Bay neighborhood is great and the T, which is the Boston Subway line is pretty much in the same building downstairs, just amazing. The neighborhood has cute unique eateries and coffee shops, as well as your staples of Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks and also great shopping. If you are here for baseball, you can walk to Fenway Park in like 10 to 12 minutes. Hamed was out of town but kept in touch via text and was very helpful with any questions we had. I would recommend for anyone trying to find a place in Boston in a great area, walking distance to pretty much the whole city.\n",
            "- The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- I was in need of a place for a last-minute trip and most hotels were booked or either $1000+ Per night. Hamed was incredibly accommodating for a last-minute request. The place is beautiful, clean, and in the perfect location. As an Airbnb host, Hamed is top notch. Made us feel as though we were staying at a friends house. I highly recommend and would absolutely stay here again!\n",
            "- Being right on Newbury street, This two bedroom apartment couldn't be in a better location. The apartment itself it so spacious and comfortable. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a better host while I was in Boston! Hamed was wonderful, he was quick to respond and even worked with me on a last minute booking and delivering an item I left at his place after my stay. Hamed was very accommodating with cold refreshments upon our arrival in the fridge and follow up after we arrived to make sure everything was to my liking! Truly a great apartment to stay and Hamed was an amazing host!!\n",

            "- I'm from the area and lived in Boston for 6 years so I think I can say with some authority that Hamed's place is absolutely the best location in Boston. The view from the apartment is much better than what is shown in the photos.  I hosted my family at the condo for Thanksgiving dinner (I asked in advance if this would be okay) and everyone had a great time; not every host would allow their place to be used in this way and I really appreciate that Hamed agreed to it.  We really enjoyed our stay  here. \n",

Open communication with Hamed made it easy to check in/out and ensured that we had everything we needed during our stay. He took genuine interest in making sure that we had a positive experience from the moment we booked with him. It is a beautiful and spacious 2 bed/2 bath with a great view and is located in a fantastic area of Boston. Everything we wanted to see was either an easy walk or short rail/taxi ride away. Thanks Hamed!\n",
            "- Hamed was a wonderful host. He was very responsive in our communication leading up to and during our stay. He was also very welcoming, stocking the fridge with beers for us to enjoy. He made check-in and check-out seamless. Best of all, he accommodated my late check-out request so I had time to get a shower and some down time in after finishing the marathon and before heading home!\n",

My husband and I were in Boston, along with my sister-in-law and her boyfriend, for our son's college graduation.  We all enjoyed our stay. The apartment was in a great location. We could walk everywhere. Hamed was gracious and very responsive. He even arranged beautiful weather! I would highly recommend staying in this apartment. \n",
            "- We stayed in Hamed's place for five nights to attend a professional conference and it was perfect! He was just the right amount of helpful without being pushy and had I not already known Boston pretty well, I'm sure we would've used his expertise even more.\n",

            "- We were a group of 4 sisters celebrating a birthday. Most in the group have celebrated 60+ birthdays to date.  Hamed's accommodation is in  a wonderful location. We walked everywhere which included the art museum, shopping, sightseeing, and dining. The restaurants nearby are fantastic. The accommodation is lovely and met our needs. Hamed was a great host. Sorry we did not get to meet face to face but communication via texting was easy and effective.\n",
            "- We had an awesome trip to Boston. It was my first time doing AirBNB. I was pretty nervous, considering there are only reviews and pictures to use to make a decision, but it turned out to be a great decision. Boston was amazing and Back Bay/ Newbury St is definitely where you want to be in the city.\n",
            "- Great apartment in a perfect location! The views from the living room, kitchen and master bedroom are fantastic. Hamed is super responsive and very proactive to make sure we got in OK, had everything we needed, and to offer advice. We had a great time. Highly recommended!\n",

            "- Hamed's apartment is in perhaps the absolute best location in the city.  Close to shops and restaurants on Newbury, within a walk to Fenway Park, right next to public transportation, etc.  The apartment was clean and modern and the building is a monitored building for safety.  Hamed was extremely helpful and attentive to the cleanliness of the apartment and to our overall enjoyment of our trip.  Highly recommend.\n",

            "- This was the perfect place for our recent trip to Boston. Situated in the heart of back bay, with skyline views of Boston, Hamed's place provides a perfect refuge or launching pad. Hamed is a great host, checking in with us to make sure everything was okay. The place is spacious, the bedrooms are very comfortable and by Boston standards the bathrooms are huge. \n",

            "- Leigh Ann was an excellent host! She made sure we had everything we needed for our two night stay, and was very easy to get in touch with for any questions we had. She also left us maps and some quick information about navigating Boston and recommendations of things to do. \n",
            "\n",

            "- Jon was a great host - when we arrived he welcomed us, helped us with our luggage, gave us a tour of the apartment, and explained the neighborhood.  We had access to the whole apartment, which was awesome.  Very cool place to stay, nice amenities, very homely and chic.  Nice view of the city and pretty cool location - about a 10 min walk from shops in Charlestown, and a quick Uber/Lyft to downtown Boston.  Good parking on weekends in front of building.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note that the outside of the building is very unassuming - very industrial.  (We didn't think we were in the right location at first and called Jon to confirm.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Would stay there again!\n",
            "- Jon was very welcoming and accommodating to my needs.  He is always nearby and accessible so if there were any questions, he was available and responded quickly.  The apartment was very clean, I felt extremely comfortable.  The bathroom in particular is amazing for a condo in Boston.  Close to the highway and nearby Charlestown restaurants.\n",

Jon was a great host. Would definitely stay again.\n",
            "- My stay at Jons apartment was awesome. The apartment itself was beautiful with everything we needed. Slept 5 guests comfortably with easy parking outside of the apartment. I would definitely stay again if I ever find myself back in Boston\n",
            "- Jon and I had a very spotless communication. My family and I arrived an hour early, but Jon had predicted that so he had hidden the key so we would let ourselves in. He is a thoughtful host and I would recommend his apartment at any time\n",
            "- Unique well designed and located dual level two bedroom apartment. This Copley Square apartment is in an old tree-lined meighborhood of row houses, all being renovated by people with money.  The entry at street level leads into the living room and remodelled adequately equipped kitchen. It overlooks the interior courtyards of the row houses and small apartment buildings. Oak floors and natural light predominate. A tight oak spiral staircase descends to the large main bedroom, tiny single bedroom and bathroom. The dual french doors from the bedroom open to the courtyard. Two blocks away there are numerous restaurants, pubs and convenience stores. 3 blocks away is the subway, with Copley Square at 5 blocks. This is a real estate rental and the company is responsive and prompt. This will be my preferred apartment for future work on Copley Square.\n",
            "- Excelente estadia. Não conheci Alicia pessoalmente, mas ela esteve sempre pronta a responder minhas dúvidas.\n",

            "\n",
            "- Very clean and spacious place. Kelly's a wonderful person and a great host. She made me homemade granola and yogurt which was excellent.  The apartment is just beneath their first floor so you can hear the footsteps above but during the evening and throughout the nights, the place and surrounding neighborhood are very quiet.  Depending on where you want to go, it might take you awhile to get there (the closest bus stop is less than a 2 minute walk though).  It's at least 40 minutes by bus (have to take two buses) to downtown.  The heart of JP is a 25-30 minute or so walk away but there are restaurants and grocery stores within a 15 minute walking distance.  Kelly and her family are wonderful people and I enjoyed sharing a couple evening meals with them.  Kelly was very flexible with my checkout time.  I would definitely stay again and recommend it to others.\n",
            "- Meeting Kelly, Jason, Henry, and Lili, is one of the best experiences that we had in Boston. We felt from the very beginning that we were arriving to our home. Kelly and Jason made us feel welcome, comfortable, and free enough to enjoy the apartment with privacy. The place is great to rest and relax after a hectic day in the city, and big enough to enjoy its different areas. You can have the best granola with yogurt on the dining table, or taste 'Seattle's best coffee' on the couch. The bedroom has a comfy Queen bed with fairly new beddings, the restroom has a nice size, relatively new towels and the kitchen has new appliances as well.\n",
            "I cooked a couple of times and I was pleased to see I had a functional kitchen just for myself! Taking into account other amenities, the Wifi worked pretty well for us during the time we stayed there, and the house is 10 minutes walking distance of the Forest Hills station.  Then you can take the orange line and go wherever you want in Boston. You can also take a short ride to the ponds and arboretums that are nearby the Jamaica Plain area.\n",
            "I definitely recommend Kelly's apartment. I have a feeling that not only I had the opportunity to spend some time with my airbnb host, but I had the opportunity to meet a new friend!\n",
            "I'm very grateful to met such amazing people. Thank you guys, and thanks airbnb!\n",
            "- It was great to have our own space.  EXTREMELY comfortable bed.  Family very pleasant and accommodating.   \n",
            "- I really can't think of a bad thing to say.  Kelly and her family were out of town when I stayed there, but we organized a good place for the key, and then I had a nice little place to hang my hat in Boston.  It's quite close to the Forest Hills T stop (10 min. walk), so you can get into the city just fine.  Really for the price, a private bathroom, it was a good deal at a time when all the Boston hotels were fully booked.  Would gladly stay there again when visiting Boston \n",
            "- The reservation was canceled 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- We stayed in this apartment for a month while house-hunting in JP, and I would definitely recommend it to other AirB&B'ers!\n",
            "Pros: The hosts!  Kelly, Jason, and their son are a lovely family and very friendly.  They are great to hang out with, but also give you your privacy.  They definitely went above and beyond as hosts go, inviting us out with them and letting us borrow odds and ends when needed.\n",
            "More pros: The apartment is pretty spacious - you have your own entrance and bed/bath/kitchen/living areas.  The bed is large (queen) and very comfortable.  We stayed during the summer and even without AC it was never too hot.  The neighborhood is very quiet and friendly, and you can easily walk or bike to the bus or T to get around.  Street parking (no permit needed) was right outside and never a problem.\n",
            "Cons: There aren't too many cons to think of, however, being a basement the space can get a little damp and musty.  The kitchen has all the basics, but if you are there long-term and planning on doing a lot of cooking you might need some extra supplies.  \n",
            "Overall our experience was really great.  This apartment is very centrally located, and a great value for a private one-bedroom.  Kelly and Jason, thanks again for a great stay!\n",
            "- This was a last minute same day booking. Kelly was extremely accommodating. I enjoyed having the entire basement apartment to myself. Place was spacious and very clean. Although the area is not commuter friendly, its only a short Uber/Taxi ride to downtown Boston. There are no eateries within walking distance however the host did provide a variety of delivery menu options which I was very thankful for. \n",
            "- The apartment was perfect for us. Very clean and nice bed. Nice basement suite with everything we needed. The neighbourhood was nice and quiet. Fairly close to the train station too.\n",
            "- Wir haben 2 Nächte bei Kelly übernachtet. Das Apartment ist recht groß und ist alles dabei was man benötigt. Die Verbindung ist auch machbar (ein 10-15 min Weg zur Metro oder man nimmt den Bus Nr. 32 zur Metro) Alles in allem ein super Aufenthalt.\n",
            "- We spent two days in Kelly's space during a recent trip to Boston. Kelly was wonderful, her apartment was private and comfortable and included it's own private entrance. Parking was safe and plentiful and the neighborhood was interesting and offered easy access to public transportation.  I highly recommend this space to fellow travelers.\n",
            "- We really enjoyed staying at the apartment. It was cozy, especially the bed. The apt had everything we needed for our 3 weeks stay, e.g., cooking utensils, hair dryer, to make us feel like home. Bus to the T station (5min ride) is around the corner, so it is quite convenient. Would definitely stay there again next time. \n",
            "- The description was accurate. We had helpful advice from both Kelly and Jason. \n",
            "- A private apartment conjoined to the house. Private entrance, near a bus stop. Walking distance to some restaurants, bars, co-op, and the arboretum. Nice hosts. Would recommend. \n",
            "- Was great to spend a month at Kelly's while we were in between houses, quiet roomy and clean environment, also a great safe neighborhood. \n",
            "Ps: thank you Kelly for the fresh basil,and the hand cut flowers.\n",
            "- Jessica and Jacob were great hosts who were very accommodating. Their apartment is gorgeous and in a prime location.\n",
            "- My family and I enjoyed our weekend at this very clean and comfortable apartment.  The unit was stocked with necessary items and the porch was an added benefit that we didn't expect.  The host was very responsive anytime I reached out with a question.  I've stayed in other vacation rentals and this was by far the best experience I've ever had.\n",
            "- The room is clean and comfortable. The location is about 10 min to the metro station.\n",
            "- Thomas and Jenny's home is beautiful.  It's modern, spacious and had a great kitchen.  It suited our needs perfectly, and Jenny was very responsive -- she made herself readily available before and during our stay.  The location was good, too.  We didn't use mass transit, but it was easy for us to jump on and off the highway headed into Boston/Cambridge.  \n",
            "- \n",
            "The listing was as we expected and the description was detailed and accurate.   There were plenty of extra towels and bedsheets, the appliances were brand new, the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped.  We would definitely stay there again if we visit Boston again.\n",
            "- The home was exactly as describe. The downstairs apartment was so quaint, comfortable and beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay.  Having this place to relax and to retreat to after a long day of touring the wonder city of Boston was great. Ubering and the T line was our transportation of choice.  It was all so very convenient from our Dorchester location. We couldn't not of asked for a more amazing place to stay and really enjoy the historical feel of Boston.  \n",
            "- The house was fantastic, it would have been great to spend some more time there.\n",
            "- We enjoyed staying at Thomas and Jenny's place. It was a great experience and would recommend it! \n",

            "- This was a great place for a group. Very clean and nice, with a great porch. It is about 30 mins to take the t into Boston however, and there were no paper products. We had to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. Other wise great!\n",
            "- Host was very welcoming. Willing to care for any issues that arose. Neighborhood was nice, busy street in front.\n",
            "One issue- 6 of us overnighted two days and only 2 rolls of toilet paper provided. We ran out and had no access to purchase any nearby.\n",
            "Plenty of towels provided; clean house, except floors were dirty. Our white socks proved it.\n",
            "We would return to house if visiting Boston, but not Cambridge; traffic was terrible. \n",
            "- What a lovely home!  Very well-appointed, comfortable, and clean.  Easy access to Boston (less than 10 minute drive).  We were in town for my niece's Christening in nearby Milton.  Thomas & Jenny's home was the perfect place to relax after a full day of events followed by a fun day of sightseeing in Boston.  Easy parking onsite was a HUGE bonus.  Street parking would have been a challenge for our large SUV. \n",
            "- My coworker and I really enjoyed staying at this house. Though it was 5-10 minutes out of Boston due to traffic, it was pretty perfect for what we needed and provided a quiet rural escape from the city after being there all day. The house was clean when we arrived and the bed sheets felt clean. There was some old fruit in the fridge that we promptly threw away. One thing we really appreciated though was how easy it was to park because it had its own parking area in the front of the property.\n",
            "\n",
            "The gripes: the TV in the kitchen area didn't work when we got there (we didn't notify Jenny because we were at the house pretty rarely and because the TV in the living area worked fine; eventually we determined it was a mis-positioned IR emitter). The other gripe would be that when someone is staying in the upstairs unit, it can be VERY noisy since the floors are wood and aren't insulated from noise. That means that either late at night or early in the morning you'll get woken up by extremely loud footsteps, rolling suitcases, or whatever. Thirdly, we noticed pretty immediately that there was an odd smell in the living area of the house; we think it may have been the smell of natural gas. \n",
            "\n",
            "Other than that, the neighborhood is cozy and quiet. There's a really good ice cream place down the street called the Boston Ice Cream Factory that was tasty. Overall, I would recommend this house, but would hope they fix the odd gas smell, which is gross as well as a little concerning. \n",
            "- Great experience! Everything was seamless and hosts were available if there were issues. There were none.\n",

            "- two men who pretended they booked the apt in second floor with the host Jennifer. THey asked us to give them access to the main door because they have the secuty code for second apt. I checked the code number on their messages.  I refused to give access. I called and texted the host around 9:30-10:00pm. Two men stayed in front of the main door until 12:30 pm. The host said that the code that I mentioned was given to a another previous guests but he reset this code already. Around 12:30, a group of guests 12-15 persons came to the apt in second floor. I saw two men left the place. I messaged to the hosts about this between 10:00-12:30 pm. They didn't answer back.  Two young men tried to get into the main door. We didnt feel secure in this stay. The host give security code to main door and inside apart door to us. Safety is important to guests. \n",

            "- Excellent location, excellent condo, excellent host. The place was exactly as depicted in the pictures, take note of all of the white! and plan accordingly if you have small kids. Julie was super helpful in planning and getting my group there, who were very unfamiliar with Boston. Within walking distance of the place there is everything you need, restaurants, grocery store, shopping. Couldn't have asked for more. Will stay here again. \n",

            "- Myself and 7 girlfriends stayed at Julie's place in Boston for a girls weekend. We had a wonderful time. The apartment was clean and exactly as listed. It's a 10 min walk to the T line and a whole bunch of great bars and restaurants. The layout of the apartment has the living room and kitchen in the basement. The kitchen is small, but worked perfectly for breakfast and snacks etc. Overall, we really enjoyed our time in Boston :) \n",

            "- Julie was an excellent host! Our place was easy to find with her directions. She allowed us to check in early as well. The area was safe and an easy walk to the seaport district. The closest T station was around a 15 minute walk. You definitely get the taste of being more like a local in this area which I loved.  The space was clean, and the beds and twin fold out bed were very soft and comfortable. The space is accommodating but small for a larger group, but this is expected in such a popular area of an urban area. Perfect for coming home to at the end of a long day exploring the city!\n",
            "- It worked very well for us. We didn't use the kitchen facilities though. It was a bit small for as many as we had. we probably would have used the kitchen if the fridge were larger. It worked great for us. The AC units were a lifesaver. All that slept there slept well. My daughter said, \"Dad, the house was exactly what we needed\". Thanks.\n",
            "- Julie's home is clean, cozy, and exactly as pictured.  The rooms were comfortable and nicely appointed, as was the common living space.  The kitchen was a little small, but we didn't really use it except to store a few things in the fridge.  Generally, the accommodations worked well for us. \n",
            "The neighborhood is quiet and charming.  The location might be a little farther out for first-timers planning to catch all the regular tourist sights in the Back Bay etc. areas, but we Ubered practically everywhere and that worked out great for us.  We used the T once--about a 10-15 minute walk to the station. But for those who have seen all the usual sites, South Boston would be fun to explore further.  We didn't eat in the area, but there seemed to be many interesting places to try.  We did discover a couple of great places for coffee and pastries.  P.S Gourmet Coffee has an amazing selection of iced coffees and mochas, and Broadway Pastry and Coffee Shop had beautiful pastries.  Both good for a quick, light breakfast.\n",
            "Julie was a wonderful, welcoming host, allowing us to store our bags upon arrival and for a few hours after check-out.  She was extremely responsive and gave us plenty of tips and recommendations.  Thanks for helping to make our trip such a great one!\n",
            "- Such a clean and great location.  Julie was constantly in touch and easy to reach.  The towels had this lovely scent and bed linens were fresh and clean. Would definitely stay here again when we are in Boston.  And we will be back!\n",
            "- Nice modern home in the Southern area of Boston. The house was perfect for the four of us and was close to bus and train station. Julie made sure everything was okay before arrival and during the stay. Thanks Julie!\n",
            "- My friends and I had a great stay at Julie's place! There were 7 of us, and we all slept comfortably. The location was great as well! This was my first Airbnb experience, and I will definitely use it in the future. \n",
            "- The home was just big enough for our family of 4 staying there for 6 nights.  It was clean, functional for staying and cooking, and in a safe neighborhood with relatively easy access to transportation and Boston sights.  Julie was a very responsive, available and nice host.  The WiFi was excellent, fast and working everywhere in the house.  The nearby market was a good source of regular and interesting groceries.  We loved the K-cup coffee maker.\n",
            "- Julie was very attentive whenever I sent her a text and responded very quickly! The AC was a much welcome reprieve, as it was a very hot and muggy weekend when we arrived in Boston.\n",

            "She was also kind enough to let us check out later to avoid us lugging our luggage around in the hot weather.\n",

            "I did get the impression that the host has had negative experiences in the past, and that did lead to us feeling unwelcome, but the experience was still overall good.\n",
            "- This house was amazing. The house was in great shape and each room had an individual AC unit (which is great for the summer when we were there). The pictures are an excellent representation of what the house looks like. Plus, we found out the owners donate their profits to charity. \n",
            "\n",
            "My only recommendation for anyone renting this house is do not come with a vehicle. Parking is virtually impossible in the area surrounding the house. We had a rental car that we ended up returning early because we could not find any place to park it. We ended up taking uber everywhere. Uber was cheap and really convenient. \n",

The place was exactly as described and in a good location with central Boston and transport hubs easily accessible. If you plan to stay in Boston and are a group of 4 or even more I'd be surprised if you find better quality and value elsewhere. \n",

            "- My parents were visiting from out of town, and this was the perfect place to stay! It's clean, comfortable, and close to everything we needed. I have to say I was especially impressed with Khurram and Nadia as hosts. They were easy to communicate with and were understanding and accommodating of last minute schedule changes. I would recommend this place without hesitation, or any other place Khurram and Nadia post. Thank you for everything! \n",
            "- The apartment is centrally located and awesome. Gorgeous views of Boston. Easy to get anywhere really. You don't need a car, which is a major plus in Boston.  Lots of space. Lots of bathrooms. Really great for my family. \n",
            "- Great spot!!  Couldn't ask for more comfortable accommodations - it really is your 'home away from home'.  Add a killer location and the reasonable rate, especially for a group stay, and this was an amazing value.  Check in was super easy and we took advantage of every bell & whistle we had time for (the gym, patio, kitchen, huge closets, snacks and coffee, and more)\n",
            "- This condo was ideal based upon the size and location.  The condo itself is spacious with spectacular views of the city.  It was accessible to a \"T\" stop and in walking distance to the North End.  Plus the on-site amenities such as the pool are great when you just want to relax and take a break from walking.  I would highly recommend for either a family or group of friends for either a family vacation or girls/guys long weekend.\n",
            "- Unfortunately  the room did not look like in the picture. There was barely any space next to the bed. When we arrived the thermostat was set low (other guests were complaining too) and the sheets and towels were stained. No one was reachable so we had to wait until the next day. All our concerns were addressed but the stained towel was just replaced with another stained one.\n",

            "- Lovely little flat that was clean and looks very much like the pictures with one double bed in one bedroom and a single bed in a second bedroom off a small study. Ana kindly left milk and cereal in the fridge so we didn't have to forage for food while jet lagged.  She also dropped us off an iron (we were travelling for work) at very short notice which was really helpful.   The flat is a  5-10 min walk to the T so we didn't have any trouble getting around, and if you're tired it's only 8-10 dollars to catch an uber from the centre of town. \n",
            "\n",
            "The neighbourhood is very noisy since it is so close to the airport and there is also a fair bit of traffic noise from the road so it might not suit you if you are a light sleeper. There also isn't a lock to the front door of the building the flat is in (I don't know how standard that is in America), which means someone could come right up to the door of the flat on the top floor. This felt a bit exposed and might have worried me if I was travelling alone. Given there are only two bedrooms, one with a single bed, it would be quite a tight squeeze for 5 people. \n",

            "We also had a bit of trouble with the air conditioning but that should be all fixed by the time the next person visits. \n",

            "- The apartement is located in a nice neighborhood very close to the airport, which was perfect in our case, because it was the last stop on our roadtrip. The apartement was very clean and we didn't miss a thing. Ana was very welcoming and always available if we had any questions. \n",
            "- The apartment is big and in a good location. The wifi was fast and we had lots of channels to watch on TV. The host was not incredibly warm when I arrived. The beds and pillows were bad. \n",
            "- Excellent location, What you see is what you get, everything was clean and perfect, I only wish they had a storage for your luggage to use it when your visit ends... Jeje... I had to carry my bags all over Boston till my plane left at 9pm... Thanks anyways and I'm sure that I'll recommend you and I would use your services again.\n",

            " \n",
            "- The apartment is nice and clean. But the management was not as professional as I wished. I confirmed the arrival time with them, TWICE, before arriving; but still, we were standing at the front door for an hour before the concierge finally let us in. I called the company a dozen times but didn't get the problem solved (they offered a gift card to apologize during the conversation, which they never sent as well..) I was disappointed and hope that they could improve their services.\n",
            "- The suite was very clean and was welcomed by the cleaning staff who showed us to our space. We had a bit of trouble with the cable, as it kept cutting out. A great location.\n",
            "- The host did not have the original listing for my stay but they worked to immediately get us better accommodations, great job\n",
            "- Listing description is accurate, Great neighbourhood, walking distance to Fenway park, Wholefoods, Marshall's, Target and many food outlets.\n",
            "- First off, our experience with this property management company (Beantown) was a 1 out of 5.  The reasons are simple - 1) Reservation made 8+ weeks in advance.  2) The day prior to arrival, I had to contact Beantown to request arrival details. 3) At that point I was notified the original place (near Fenway) was not available, and they had another place for us (2 couples, 4 adults) in a less desirable part of town (Seaport, far end).  4) after asking all the qualifying questions about the \"new location\" we reluctantly agreed to the move.  5) Upon arrival we found a nice place, but with \"prison towels\" suitable for 2.5 persons, NOT the 4 adults we had confirmed and reconfirmed.  6) An additional bath towel was provided 20+ hours later. 7) The host advised at time of change we'd get a $90 refund, and then later after confirming, this was actually $63.  8) I asked the reservation person about this and they blamed the discrepancy on AirBnb (I have the emails).  The only reason I give them a \"1\" out of 5 is that the quality of the \"new\" place was very good, and when I called to complain about the towel situation, someone actually answered the phone and later called back.  9) The kicker ...  when I asked about airport noise before agreeing to the change, I was told there was \"no airport noise\".  Wrong, very wrong.  One Park Lane (Seaport Apartments) is directly under the flight path for all those early morning departments starting at 5:15 am for every day we were there.\n",

Conveniently located next to practically everything from a CVS, a Whole Foods, a Target not to mention all the food and drink near Fenway.  Highly, highly recommend!\n",
            "- The host canceled this reservation 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- The apartment was clean, the building nice.  The best part of this place is the location!  Especially if you are in town to watch some ball games.  Super close to restaurants, bars, and right at a T stop.  One possible negative, if you are on the side of the building with the T platform and the train running by, as we were, it can be noisy.  Didn't bother me but I could see it being a problem for some people. \n",
            "- Bret was really accommodating and very responsive. My flight came in really late and he was able to make it work. Great spot with amazing views. \n",
            "- I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Bret's place! It was such an easy check in, Bret was very responsive and the place was absolutely stunning and very close to all of the restaurants in the seaport.\n",
            "- Just spent the weekend in Boston with my husband and dog, and Bret's apartment was the perfect place! Very clean and tidy, a comfy bed, strong wi-fi, and enough space that it was a pleasure just to hang around during our downtime. The whole building is really nice and hotel-like and seems really new, and it was easy to find. Bret responded quickly to all my questions, and was super helpful with recommending parking garages (we went with Necco St Garage about a 10-15 min walk). The neighborhood is new so it's not nearly as busy or loud as downtown, and it was a great place to walk the dog in the morning. For fun, Harpoon Brewery is only a few blocks away, and there are seafood restaurants everywhere as well as a concert pavilion. Downtown was about a 30 minute walk. We would definitely stay here again!\n",
            "- Bret was incredibly helpful. He was always available to answer to my questions and made sure that everything went well. The location of the apartment is amazing and the apartment is perfect. Will definitely stay here again.\n",
            "- This is a brand new building with terrific location.  It is steps from the Silver Line stop which, if you care arriving from airport, is free.  The building itself is very safe, with 24 hour front desk and security features.   The seaport district of Boston is a new trendy area of this great city.  It is a short walk to the convention center and quick metro ride to other parts of Boston.  If using Lyft or Uber, the cars all arrived in minutes and  were able to pull right up to the front door.   There are lots of new restaurants, at all price levels, near the waterfront and there will soon be more shops which are now being built.   Bret was a great communicator and is a new Airbnb host.  He was very flexible and since he was out of town, we were able to communicate closely by text thereby quickly answering all questions I had.    It would be great to stay at his place again.  \n",
            "- Bret was a great host, the apartment was top notch. The location couldn't be better. It is right next to the subway stop and the convention center as well as many restaurants. I would recommend Bret's place to anyone. It's 5 stars in my opinion.\n",
            "- bret's place was excellent! a new modern place,  great location in a new trendy area with many nice restaurants and next to t stop. bret is very accommodating,  flexible and responsive. only wish a supermarket was closer\n",
            "- Bret is a friendly and responsive host with a great place near downtown Boston. Perfect if you want to stay in seaport area or spend a lot of time downtown. \n",
            "- We had a wonderful 17 days in Boston and lot of it was because of Lisa's apartment. Everything was just as pictured and all that was written in description was provided. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathroom was luxurious and clean, the kitchen was big and well-stocked. It was really perfect for anyone looking for a home away from home.\n",
            "Lisa was a great host and provided us all the informations about the apartment.\n",
            "Would absolutely stay here again.\n",
            "Thank you, Lisa!\n",
            "- Owner is very sweet and helpful.  He was very open to our recommendations for changes.  There is one double bed and one twin, so realistically, it sleeps three.  There is also a twin air mattress, but there isn't really a carpeted spot to put it so it would be a hard night's sleep.  Apartment is part of a three story home, so access is to whole house, not apartment.  Cannot lock up your area, except from inside apartment.  Easy walk to the T (community college on the orange line), which takes 3 or 4 stops to get you to most of town and stations where you may change to other lines.\n",
            "- Joe is a gracious host and very accommodating. We had the whole second floor. It is an old Victorian, so if you enjoy history this is a great place to stay.  It is only a few blocks from the Bunker Hill Monument. It served our purpose of needing a place to stay near Boston for the weekend as it was college graduation weekend in Boston. We would stay there again.\n",
            "- My family loved staying in Charlestown, and Joe was a wonderful host. He is very friendly, and my parents, especially, got along with him especially well. Even though I lived in Cambridge for 4 years, I had never really seen Charlestown and think it was great to stay there and take public transportation to Boston (highly recommend the ferry ride) and Cambridge. \n",
            "- Joe was definitely a life saver. Arrived in Boston to find just about every hotel in the area fully booked. I had never been to Charlestown but both the area and the home were just wonderful-reminded me a little of East Providence. After regularly staying it hotel rooms it was nice to stay somewhere that felt homey. I didn't get a chance to connect with Joe much but he made himself available if I needed anything. Also the bed was incredibly comfortable. Would highly recommend to others.\n",
            "- We really enjoyed staying in this cute apartment. Joe is an incredibly hospitable guy and even went out of his way to show us around Charlestown. The apartment is very homely and welcoming.\n",
            "- Great place, great location, awesome host! Joe has told us tons of stories about Charlestown and other local places, events, gave us a lot of recommendations etc. Joe is the person you need when visiting new city, he is insider and local. Joe is the man in Charlestown!\n",
            "- We had fun staying at Joe's traditional victorian house. Charlestown is a very quiet residential area nevertheless very convenient location for walking downtown. Joe is a very friendly host.\n",
            "- Joe was an extremely friendly and accommodating host. He was very helpful in allowing us to stay late on the final day and even offered up his parking space for us. He kept our fridge stocked throughout the stay and was full of local knowledge. The apartment itself is a lovely place to stay, very interesting and elegant and in a nice neighbourhood. It is conveniently located for visiting both Boston and Cambridge.  I would definitely recommend Joe and his apartment when visiting Boston. \n",
            "- We really enjoyed our short stay in Joe's house and in Charlestown.  Joe made me, my wife and three children feel very welcome.  We'd had real trouble getting somewhere to stay for all five of us, even though the kids are all young, but Joe let us all squeeze in  - not that it really was a squeeze in this large apartment.  \n",
            "- Joe seems to be a great guy and was very helpful the night that we arrived. \n",

            "Place itself is a little old and should be renovated soon.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Joe's place was comfortable, beautiful, and in a nice neighborhood. Joe himself was also a great host -- he was friendly and helpful and he even showed us around the Charlestown area! Would highly recommend this property to other travelers. My only warning is that, although this property is close to the downtown area of Boston (called the North End), it is somewhat (but not overly difficult) to access the Harvard Campus by public transit. So if that is what you are looking for then perhaps you should try something closer to Cambridge proper.\n",
            "- Joe was a great host.  He was very accommodating and very knowledgeable about the area.  His apartment was spacious and inviting.  The fresh fruit and bagels were an excellent touch.  The place was a very short walk to an orange line T (the subway) stop and a local ferry.  Taxi rides were usually around 10 bucks from anywhere downtown.  Boston is a great city to visit, and Joe's apartment is a great place to stay.  \n",
            "- Great location and great accommodations.  Location in Charlestown was within walking distance to Bunker (Breed's Hill), the Constitution, the ferry to downtown Boston and also to a grocery, post office and liquor store. \n",
            "We were a little surprised at a couple things. We hadn't read the description carefully (or had read too many and were confused!) but had expected a kitchen. Also, the description says it's an \"entire home apartment.\" Space-wise it is, but for each bedroom to have access to the bathroom, the doors must be open that lead to the middle stairwell used by the apartment above and below (front door of building secure).  Joe gave us a key to the front door. To lock the apartment, use the slide bolts on the inside of two doors and the master lock on the outside of the other.\n",
            "The rooms really are nice and comfortable - old and cool\n",
            "Joe was more than hospitable. He was very flexible with our unknown schedule for arrival and helped us find a parking space for our car (not easy!)  \n",
            "We had bought 3 lobster in Maine to cook for our dinner. When we realized our mistake in expecting a kitchen, Joe amazingly offered to let us use his kitchen. All 4 of us ate a wonderful dinner while hearing stories of Boston and Charlestown!\n",
            "We very much enjoyed meeting Joe, our visit and our stay - thanks to Joe for a great place and info of the area\n",
            "- Joe was very kind to accept my last minute booking request. The apartment is in a great location a short walk from the subway. {Community College stop}. Make sure you take the ferry over to the heart of Boston as Joe suggested $1.79 one way. Thanks to Joe we had a great short visit with plenty of room for the three of us. The personal touch of Joe makes the difference. I would deffinatly stay again'\n",
            "- Joe was a great host, very considerated, when we arrived with my friends he went to the harbor with us, to show us where to take the ferry downtown. Besides, his apartment is superbly located, just half an hour walk from downtown Boston, so in the evenings we just walked back. We had a great time in Boston. \n",

            "The house itself is a magnificent piece of 1875 and you can smell the old wood. You get the entire 2nd floor so it's like you own an apt up there with everything handy.\n",

It is located in a nice neighborhood, just half an hour walk from downtown Boston. We can highly recommend it to everyone. We had a great time in Boston. Thank you Joe for everything.\n",
            "- Out of six places I have stayed in USA (2 places in Washington DC, 2 places in New York, 1 in Philadelphia, and 1 in Boston), Joe is the best host, very accomodating and always puts the guests interest first. On our check out day, our bus departed at 10pm at night, and Joe allowed us to stay around and leave our luggages in his house till 8pm. He spent time to talk with us; shared about Boston history, the surrounding, and his personal life experiences. What a great host! I highly recommend anyone who would like to travel to Boston, to stay in his place. If I were to choose, the cleanest and nicest city to roam around in USA is Boston (at least better than Washington DC, New York, Philadelphia, Miami).\n",

            "Thanks! Joe!   \n",
            "- This was a great place.  The location was about 5 minutes walk to the Orange line T stop and the neighborhood seems very safe with a grocery and liquor store nearby.  The place was very roomy and comfortable.  It is an older place, but the beds were comfortable.  Joe was very gracious and he actually took us to the airport at the end of our stay.  The only down side of this place was that there was no wireless internet available on site and the TV was an older type with somewhat limited channel selection, but if you know that going in, it is not a big deal.\n",
            "- Joe was a great host. His place is classic (very authentic Charlestown) in an excellent location!\n",
            "- We had a lovely stay in Boston and Joe was a very welcoming and friendly host.  The apartment was well-located and very clean.  I would happily recommend anyone stay with Joe.

            "- Joe was very nice...he met us at the street and took our largest bag from he cab and carried it on up.  His place was clean and cozy.  Joe had gone to the grocery store and stocked the frig with water/gatorade, juice, and milk.  He even provided us with fruit.\n",

The apartment was cute, clean, and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place to friends, family, and other airbnb travelers. Thanks so much, Joe!\n",
            "- This apartment is located near the finest portion of Bunker Hill residential area. It can be quickly and easily reached from Boston Intl airport by public transport, if your luggage is light and you are physically fit of walking for a short distance uphill. The apartment is charming and spacious. When you are there, do not forget to visit the famous Warren Tavern, it is just within a short walk. As a host, Joe is great! He knows Boston well and can tell you interesting stories about different parts of the city. On the day of our departure, Joe kindly offered us a ride to airport. All of us were satisfied for this stay.\n",
            "- This is a great place to stay. We met up with another couple for a long weekend. There was plenty of room for the 4 of us and we felt like we got a much more thorough Boston experience than a hotel would have given us. Thanks to Joe's recommendations, we were able to live like locals. Totally relaxing space, excellent host, great location.\n",

            "- The host Joe is the true star of the show here rather than the accommodation. He goes out of his way to make your stay  a memorable one. From making sure we had bagels for breakfast to dropping us off downtown on our last day, Joe is the perfect host. The apt is good value for money if in need of a little updating. The living room is splendid especially when the sun comes pouring in in the morning and the bedrooms are quite acceptable. The diner/ kitchen area leaves a little to be desired. There is no sink so you have to wash all your crockery and cutlery in the bathroom sink. The bathroom itself is a little old- fashioned and we struggled to get a hot shower at any time during our 2-day stay. That said, we enjoyed our time at Joe's place and would have no qualms about booking the apt again. Charlestown is a lovely part of Boston even if it is some way to the downtown district with all its tourist attractions. On the other hand, it is close to Boston's North End district and its clutch of fun Italian restaurants - old- style Italian plenty of atmosphere. Mark\n",
            "- Absolutely fantastic stay. Unfortunately, it wasn't me, but my husband and my in laws, fresh off the plane from Italy, had such a wonderful time. They said the house was cozy and comfortable, the location amazing, and Joe a lovely host. Thank you! I am sure we will be back. \n",
            "- Joe is a kind and gregarious host who went out of his way to help us get where we needed to go when we came to town to take my son to his college orientation.  The space, the second floor of a rowhouse, is very clean and fitted with everything we needed; though it doesn't have a full kitchen, there was a small hotplate, a coffeemaker and a small refrigerator stocked with a few handy essentials, and a well-thought-out supply of utensils, dishcloths, etc.  The space opens on to a stairwell leading up to Joe's living space on the third floor--it's not possible to close it off 100% as if it were a completely separate apartment, and this might be an issue for some potential guests, but we were fine with it.  We loved staying in Charlestown, which was quiet, safe and very charming, and only a few minutes' walk across a bridge from the North End (in fact one end of the Liberty Trail was very close to the apartment).  A great stay, and Joe is a wonderful host! \n",
            "- My parents and I stayed at Joe’s place while we were in Boston for a wedding.  Even though the house is older, the place was very clean and in a great location near to the T and to groceries, liquor store, pharmacy, restaurants, etc.  Joe was even kind enough to drive my parents to the wedding and also drive us all to the airport the day we left.  The only thing that didn’t work out for us was the lack of wifi, but I think Joe had mentioned that that was being fixed ASAP.  I would recommend this place for the ease of access to Boston and the great host!\n",
            "- Setting the stage:  With two young teens visiting from Germany, we had a LOT to explore in a short period of time. Not only had we been invited to celebrate the 4th on the harbor... we wanted to get in some serious sightseeing the day before. \n",
            "\n",
            "In a way, we have nothing with which to compare as this is our first AirBnB experience but Joe went out of his way to make it work for us: communication was easy, he provided walking maps and plenty of direction.... even walked with us in search of pizza one night and made sure the boys had car snacks for the way home.  Oh... and when he learned how we wanted to spend our day Joe also offered to let us drop our bags and pick up our key before check-in time. (He was still doing the changeover but this was a HUGE help to us.)\n",

            "Also, the location worked VERY well for us.  If you have the opportunity (and the weather) take the \"T\" ferry from the ship yard to the aquarium... although walking past the Bunker Hill monument and on through the North End is pretty awesome, too. \n",
            "- Joe went above and beyond for us.  In addition to being a gracious host, he offered to drop us off in town as he had to run an errand in that direction at the same time.  The house is lovely... spacious.  We had more room than we knew what to do with.  Would easily accommodate 4 people.  There's a kitchenette that he stocks with milk, water, bread, eggs, bagels, yogurt and fruit!  We couldn't have been more pleased and we've told everyone about it that we know. \n",
            "- Joe was an excellent host! I stayed with my family for three days and it was by far the best place where we could have stayed. The house is lovely and it fits perfectly 4 guests, it s very spacious. It has two rooms, a living room and bathroom. It also has a place to cook if you want to, and the best of all is that Joe keeps it stocked with milk, coffee, bagels and juice! Also, Joe gave us a ride to Harvard and then, on day we were leaving, to the train station very early in the morning. He was always ready to give us recommendations about where to go and telling us about Boston history.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "- Staying at Joe's place was a wonderful experience.  Joe goes the extra mile for his guests.  He is very friendly and fun to talk to.  It was great meeting a  Boston native who had great suggestions for our stay.  He even took us to Harvard and to the airport.  The accommodations were adequate and the location is awesome.  It was easy to walk to downtown Boston and convenient to the T line.  Also really appreciated the breakfast food he provided.  We would definitely stay here again if we make it back to Boston.\n",
            "- We had a fantastic time in Charlestown.  Joe's comfortable, very clean, and roomy place was perfect for us.   Everything we needed was there, from fresh breakfast foods to a great collection of tour guide maps and books.  Just the right blend of comfort and down home relaxedness.  Joe was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed his insider tips on where to go.  (Really great location, within walking distance of the Freedom trail, Bunker hill, The Constitution,ferry, North end, and public transportation.)  We highly recommend staying here!\n",
            "- Not much to say to add to the great reviews listed here already.  We had a great time in Boston.  Joe was great.  The location is excellent.  We were there for seven days, so had a chance to explore the neighborhood, which is not tourist oriented.  Rather it is where people live.  We felt safe there, and there were enough shops to meet our needs. (A unique Morroccan restaurant was discovered, by accident - great food)  Access to the T and to the ferry was handy. Joe's description of his place is right on. He has provided a space that maintains the character of the housing's heritage.  The newly renovated one bedroom on the lower floor is beautiful!  Our group (two couples) occupied the two bedroom second floor.  While not quite as comfortably appointed, it was more than adequate and Joe was attentive to our needs.  I would highly recommend this place and this host.  Just be aware you are not  checking into the Hilton.  Then again, if you are looking for the Hilton you probably wouldn't be cruising this site looking for a bargain.  Charlestown is a good place to stay, and Joe is a host who cares about his clients.  His personality and his place contributed greatly to a memorable holiday.  The long term cost is going to be the annual price of a stamp, as we now have a new friend added to our Christmas card list.  See you again Joe - maybe for attendance at some college hockey games next time.  PS - loved the accent, eh!\n",

            "- Joe was the best host we've had with AirBNB so far.  He did everything possible to make us comfortable, including helping us find parking, suggesting transportation options and providing milk, juice, coffee (sorry we didn't eat the bagels, Joe!).  His place is very spacious and comfortable and was perfect for my husband and our two adult daughters.  \n",
            "- Joe was an extremely helpful host. The apartment is very large and characterful. \n",
            "- Joe's apartment was fantastic - both rooms were a good size and easily fitted the comfortable queen beds. The kitchen/dining room and separate sitting room were great places to relax and the bathroom was perfect for our needs. The location of the apartment was great - walking distance to several great pubs and restaurants, a nearby laundromat, and the start of the Freedom Trail. It was conveniently located a quick walk from the train station and several bus stops (not to mention the ferry). Joe himself was very warm and welcoming, and full of tips and advice on Boston. He lives on a separate floor of the same house but was always happy to pop in for a chat or to provide assistance or directions when needed!\n",
            "- The apartment is in a good neighborhood and is conveniently located to Boston. Joe is interesting and pleasant. The pictures shown for the 2 br  unit are of the 1 bedroom unit downstairs,  The 1 bedroom unit has been redone and is nice.  The 2 br unit upstairs has not been redone and is very funky. Reminded me of my college living apartment.  Pictures are not shown for the 2 br unit. In summary, 2 stars for the 2 br unit.  I would give 5 stars to the 1 br unit\n",
            "- We have enjoined the stay at Joe's place and considered this as one of the highlights during our visit to Boston.

            "- We enjoyed our stay at Joe's place very much. His knowledge of Boston and the area was helpful on numerous occasions. If you stay make sure you visit Warren Tavern For a drink or a great meal. This cozy apartment was walking distance to every thing we needed and wanted to do. There was no need to rent a car. Next time I'm in Boston I will defiantly stay at \"Joe's Place\" \n",

            "- After being in Hirricane Sandy Joe was a knight in shining armour for us. He was going to take a break and not have anyone stay that week ( so he told us later) but felt for us as we had been in New York with no power for 4 days. Joe is an extremely welcoming, kind and generous host. He left us coffee, eggs, bagels and fruit to name a few. The house is lovely old world  charm and he has plenty things to look at around every corner. The beds were super comfy also and it was so quiet. Yet, it was so close to the North end which has great Italian restaurants. We LOVED our stay in Boston. Our only gripe. It wasn't long enough! We would definitely recommend for a short or long stay. Joe also dropped us to the airport. Which was a nice touch.  Come visit us down under Joe. We would love to have you stay with us.  You are a great conversationalist! \n",

Joe has worked hard to make the apartment comfortable, and the planned kitchen renovations will add to this.\n",
            "- Fabulous location and host who knows the area inside out. Apartment is cosy, not flash, very homely and Joe was on hand for queries and conversations. He dropped us at the airport after our stay gratis and introduced us to the Warren Tavern where we had an excellent and very late meal the night we arrived. I'd also recommend the Moroccan Tangerino restaurant in the neighbourhood.\n",

Joe was an amazing host who was really friendly and helpful even prior to check in and was really accommodating to our request to leave our bags in the apartment earlier than the scheduled check in time when our plane arrived early. Joe is a great conversationalist and we had so much fun chatting with him during our short stay. He also left us plenty of breakfast items so we didn't have to go out shopping for them, which was a really nice touch! Joe's apartment is very accessible and within easy walking distance to most amenities and attractions. We practically walked everywhere during our trip and that was great for soaking in what Boston had to offer. I would highly recommend staying with Joe if you're planning on visiting Boston! \n",

Nestled in a quaint and quiet little neighborhood, just a couple blocks from Bunker Hill, the place is also only a 15 minute walk or ferry ride to the lively North End.  Joe provided us with eggs, fruit, orange juice, milk, water and bagels.  I know where we'll be staying the next time we come to Boston.\n",

Charlestown is a beautiful area. Safe and clean and a lovely community feel. Joe adds a very personal touch with bagels, milk, eggs and even a bottle of wine left for us. There are limited cooking facilities - enough for breakfast and simple meals. Great to have things like a hair dryer and soap provided. Joe was very friendly and is the type of Airbnb host  that makes the experience so much better than a hotel. I wish we'd stayed longer. We'd recommend at least three full days in Boston - fabulous city. Thanks Joe for your generosity. \n",
            "- Joe was very accommodating!  He gave us directions and suggestions of places to go and how to get around from his place.

            "\n",
            "- Our accommodations were just what we were promised with a few surprises.  Joe left in our 'kitchen area' a bottle of wine, everything for coffee, fresh fruit and flowers.

He took a sincere interest in us as guests by sharing as much with us about Boston and his neighborhood as we needed to make our stay easy and enjoyable.

We were not missing anything. The neighborhood is really quite and on the weekend we even found a parking spot right in front of the door.

To sum it up, we would go there again for our next visit in Boston.\n",

I bet every other guests who had stayed at Joe's place would agree that he is very welcoming and friendly. No wonder that his guests left so many warm greetings from all over the world to him in his place (Joe dedicates a whole wall by the stairs to allow guests to leave their marks).

            "La maison en elle même est située dans un quartier très sympa, tout proche du centre ville de Boston. Pour s'y rendre, deux solutions qui prennent environ 30 minutes : Soit à pieds entre traversant un petit pont. Soit en faisant une partie du chemin grâce à un ferry qui relie Charlestown à l'aquarium de Boston (plein centre). L'avantage du ferry est d'avoir une vue très jolie sur Boston depuis la mer.\n",

            "- Joe met us at the door eventhough it was late night. \n",
            "Joe provided food for the refrigerator so we did not have to go to grocery the night we arrived. Joe accommodated our needs, including getting us another DVD player when we couldn't get the first one to work correctly. Very hospitable, clean and great location. \n",
            "- I enjoyed my long weekend stay at Joe's house on the 2nd floor. It was a spacious 2 bedroom, plus living room with a private bathroom and kitchen. I stayed with 2 other family members and we had plenty of space. Joe was so warm and welcoming when we arrived a few hours later then expected. He stocked a mini fridge for us with breakfast essentials and even had a bottle of wine to welcome us. His house is full of stories, old photographs and Boston history. Charlestown is a very safe and quiet neighborhood, in great walking distance to the pier (great for the morning run) and a 25 min walk to North End where there's so much great food. I took an uber to JP to meet a friend and it was cheap and quick also. Parking was abundant on the weekend and easy to find a 2 hour spot during the weekday. I highly recommend this place if you want to see what Boston is really about! \n",
            "- Fantastic location and delightful house. We had our 6 year old with us and the two bedrooms plus living space and kitchenette worked perfectly for all of us without feeling cramped. Joe is a great host and very helpful. He even provided all the makings for breakfast which was a great surprise.  No question we would go here again!  \n",
            "- Want a charming, neighborhood feel within the City of Boston?  Then, this is place to rent.  Joe is very hospitable and accommodating to his guests.  2nd floor of this 1800's home is as advertised and more than adequate for a family of four. Loved the spaciousness of this floor and the quiet of the neighborhood FAR BETTER than being in a hotel where you never know who is going to be in the room next door.  My teenagers also enjoyed being in Joe's home over a hotel with a pool!!!\n",

            "- Joe was an excellent host, very welcoming and informative. Gave us an impromptu tour of the neighborhood our first evening, and was very helpful with recommendations for dining, activities, etc. Also provided bagels, fruit, coffee, milk, eggs, etc. for breakfast. Lovely, very spacious flat, and in a fabulous location! Good books, films, comfortable chairs, very comfy bed. I highly recommend this host, and plan to make a return visit in the fall. \n",
            "- This apartment was great. Joe provided some breakfast food and juice for us and bottle of wine! We wish the air conditioning had been a bit better but for months of the year other than July, it probably would be fine. The location wasn't super central, but it was a close walk to grocery shopping, a few restaurants, a subway station and the bunker hill monument and the USS Constitution. We would definitely stay here again!\n",
            "- We had a very nice stay at Charlestown,  Boston. Joe was very helpful and gave us hints to visit the city. It was very nice of him to fill the fridge with a full nice breakfast. Flat was nice and roomy for 4 people. Just at the beginning of the Freedom trail, flat is well situated. Thank you Joe once again for your hospitality. All the family was very happy. Of course we recommend Joe's flat.\n",
            "- Joe was a great host.  He went out of his way to get us fresh ground coffee which was much appreciated \n",

            "- Everything was great, maybe watch out for the landlady though.\n",
            "- Beth's place is tucked away in a quiet part of the neighborhood while at the same time being right in the middle of everything.  The room and experience was everything we hoped for.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the sitting area was a perfect place to sit and relax.  Beth had a binder full of brochures and suggestions for touring as well as recommendations of places to eat.   The little amenities made a big difference.  We were glad for the mini fridge, microwave and coffee pot.  Beth and her husband allowed us to check in hours early and made us feel welcome. We would highly recommend Beth's place to anyone wanting to visit and explore Boston.  Thank you both for such a wonderful experience!\n",
            "- I loved staying st Beth's Place! I had a three day business trip to Boston and her lovely church guest room was in the perfect location for me to walk everywhere. The room was cozy and had all I needed and the church gathering room was available for sitting.  I am planning a return trip in a week or two and will look no further! A very historic area of Boston with tons of charm. Parking in that area is very scarce so plan to pot your car in the nearby lot which cost me $60 for three days. But you won't need your car at all if you stay at Beth's! The bathroom is a bit of a walk though the church lobby so bring a bathrobe! Perfect place. \n",
            "- Beth and David were wonderful hosts, who did everything possible to make my stay comfortable. Their little church in the North End of Boston-- super convenient to everything--is a piece of paradise.  The angels must have been watching over me, as I enjoyed three great nights of sleep, and haven't slept that well in ages.\n",

            "The price is fair but extra fees seem a little excessive given the size of the room.\n",
            "- We enjoyed staying at Beth's place. The room was perfect for us. Beth has worked very hard to have all of the essentials (and non-essentials) convenient. She has many resources such as books and brochures about the area. Beth was a very enthusiastic, gracious, and welcoming host who we enjoyed getting to know. The North End is an amazing and interesting area with tons to see and do (and eat!).\n",

            "\n",
            "- The location is in the historic North End district of Boston within short walk to Mike's Pastry shop.  The room was cozy and had a little kitchenette with snacks, tea and coffee. Elizabeth's chicken soup with cornbread was amazing, I hope you're as luck as I'm to give it a try.  Thank you for hosting me!\n",
            "- Beth and her husband were wonderfully welcoming and their place was clean, comfortable and well appointed. The neighborhood is great, and not far from the subway (T). I was very glad to have been able to stay with them, and would certainly return. \n",
            "- This was my first Airb&b experience and it was fabulous. Everything about the room was nicer then described. It was clean and beautiful and had everything a traveler might need. The bathroom was spacious. I cannot say enough about Beth. She is a pure delight, kind and generous. This was a surprise weekend for my husband and she made the whole weekend extra special. She was helpful ever step of the way. She was understanding of our late arrival. I felt like family. We are looking to go back to Boston and will stay there again. You cannot go wrong staying here. Also her place is in walking distance to everything. \n",
            "- This was our first trip to Boston and we could not have asked for a better location or host experience. Beth and David were friendly and accommodating, offering us a ride from the airport (for an additional charge). The room was clean and has plenty of amenities including snacks, wifi, a private restroom and use of a washer/dryer. The church is historic and quiet located in Little Italy close to tons of amazing restaurants, cafes, bars, and a short walk to the Haymarket metro and other historical landmarks. We would definitely stay at Beth's Place again when we come back!\n",
            "- This was a wonder place to stay! The room is cozy and comfortable but with nice high ceilings so you don't feel cramped. I loved all the amenities,  like the bottled water in the fridge and a robe . Beth and  her husband were both super helpful and she was kind enough to loan me a jacket when the weather turned out colder and more blustery than expected .  I also  appreciated Beth moving some laundry for us. We loved being in the North End with lots of hustle and bustle but still being close enough to walk to the T to get to other neighborhoods .\n",
            "- Beth was very accommodating in terms of my arrival and departure times.  The room was clean and had everything I needed for my short stay in Boston - microwave, coffee maker, mini frig.  \n",
            "- Beth has been really welcoming, pacient and truly a great host. Their place was amazing. I made the reservation for my mother and her partner and they felt really comfortable. The room was clean, spacious  and with all the things needed for a pleasant stay. Also, the neighborhood couldn´t be better! \n",
            "- Description was accurate. Location is great. Note this is a working church so if you are here on a Sunday the churchgoers may be using the bathroom also. Check in and check out were easy, Beth was nice and accommodating to us. Room had Netflix to use. Boston is expensive so this had what we needed for a reasonable price.\n",
            "- Accoglienza perfetta!Beth e suo marito sono stati molto gentili e disponibili. Ottima posizione per visitare Boston!\n",
            "- Beth and her husband were amazing hosts. Great location in Little Italy surrounded by many things to see and do, and a cozy room with a super comfortable bed. Absolutely would stay here again! \n",
            "- Our experience at Beth's was so great that I don't even know where to begin.  I could go on and on about what a perfect location it was and close to everything we wanted to do, or how clean and pristine our accommodations were, or how reasonable the rate was, but what REALLY made our stay special was our hosts:  From the time we rounded the corner upon arrival and saw Dave outside BBQing and getting invited to dinner, to the moment we left, we were made to feel like family.  Where you stay can make or break a vacation, and Beth's definitely made our Boston vacation a success!  I have no reservation in highly recommending Beth's Place!\n",
            "- We had such a great time in Boston! Beth and Dave a wonderful hosts and their church is located in the safe and picturesque North End. It is located just off the Freedom Trail (a must-do in Boston) and literally just a 2 minute walk from the famous Old North Church! \n",
            "\n",
            "The room is fully furnished with any amenities you might need and the bed is really comfortable! We were able to come and go at any time, including veeerrrry late one night after a soccer game at Gillette Stadium. The bathroom down the hall is very clean and might be shared with other guests. For less than the cost of an Uber/taxi, Dave picked us up at the airport when we arrived, which we really appreciated! We would highly recommend staying at Beth's place!\n",
            "- Beth's Place was a wonderful experience for our exploration of Boston.  Beth was so welcoming, asking us if there was anything we needed, providing extra things (like a knife and cutting board) when I mentioned I had bought lemons, but couldn't use them, giving helpful insights of where to go and how to get there.  The atmosphere of her place made us feel so at home.\n",
            "It was a wonderful location for getting to public subways and historic sites.  Our stay there was one of the highlights of our trip.\n",
            "- Beth and Dave were great, made you feel right at home. Location is great, a block to the ocean, a block to the Freedom trail.\n",

            "- I think this was the best place to stay in boston. we were in the middle of all the great restaurants, tourist attractions, great nightlife, and best walking areas. the room was very cozy and had everything we needed. the shared bathroom was definitely not an issue at all. it was all great. the host was very lovely and recommended great places to eat which we did try. I highly recommend this place.\n",

            "The location was perfect, right around the corner from the Freedom Trail, and so many Italian Restaurants!\n",
            "- My daughter and I had a great time! Beth's place is in walking distance of many things to see--literally just a few yards from the Freedom Trail. Beth is a great host. The room we stayed in was the best furnished room I've ever stayed in (fridge, microwave, Keurig, hotpot, iron, TV, rob, snacks, etc.). Had I needed anything that she hadn't provided, I'm sure she would have produced it if I'd asked.  We felt safe and welcomed. I hope we get to return.\n",
            "- It was great. The room was nice and our hosts were very nice. The North End neighborhood was fantastic. The place was literally 30 steps from Hanover Street in the heart of the North End with dozens of the best Italian restaurants in Boston.\n",
            "- Beth's place was a perfect fit for us. Beth is a very warm, congenial host who went out of her way to make us feel welcome. She gave us some great advice for our stay in Boston, we especially enjoyed the tip about getting the water taxi across the harbour on our arrival! It was very clear to us that Beth takes great pride and care in the accommodation that she provides. The location, in Boston's North End, is brilliant. We were surrounded by any number of fabulous restaurants and an easy walk down to the harbour area. Thank you Beth, if we come to back to Boston in the future we would love stay with you again.\n",
            "- Beth was wonderful about keeping in contact with us, so that when we arrived, she had let us know what to expect. She was there to meet us and help us with anything that we needed. Our room was very nice and we were very close to everything, a lot of the historic sites, and being in Little Italy was wonderful. The people were so nice and the food was great. We would highly recommend staying at Beth's place. You won't be disappointed, we miss it already.\n",
            "\n",
            "- This is the perfect place to stay! The location is within walking distance of all the sights, and even though Beth was out of town, she was extremely accomodating and helpful.\n",

The room is quiet and very clean, it's also right in the heart of the North End. Walking distance to all the sights. We would love to stay again, next time for longer that two nights! \n",
            "- This was a great place to stay!  It's steps from Hanover Street in the middle of the North End and just a minute's walk to the Freedom Trail.  Beth though of everything a traveler could possibly need and has it available in the room.  Bathroom might be shared with guests in another room, but that was never a problem.  The bathroom is spotless; having a washer/dryer available allows for packing light.  I will stay with Beth again if visiting Boston.\n",
            "- Best made us feel very welcome and she provided great advice on how to get to her place. Once we arrived, she gave us tips on navigating the area and where to eat. The room had everything we could have needed and the location was perfect for our short trip. Thanks again Beth!\n",
            "- Beth's place was in a wonderful location to see all of Boston. Close to the Freedom Trail, amazing North end full of Italian restaurants, quaint side streets and Mike's Pastry. She was a very friendly host, accommodating and made our stay pleasurable. Beth met us upon arrival, gave us lots of hints on the area and let us arrive early and store our luggage upon check out. Boston is wonderful to walk but not with bags in tow. Would recommend staying at Beth's Place to all!\n",
            "- Amazing location, so close to all the Boston attractions. North End is a fantastic neighbourhood. Such a nice stay at Beth's place.\n",
            "- Staying at Beth's Place was perfect! Located in arguably Boston's most incredible neighborhood, our room was immaculately clean and we felt comfortable and safe the entire time. She accommodated everything we asked for, including allowing us to drop off our bags in the common room well before our check-in time. This was a huge convenience for us, as we were able to explore Boston without our bags for hours before check-in. We recommend Beth's Place wholeheartedly. It was simply the best!\n",
            "- The room is cozy and works well for the busy, adventurous traveler. The bathroom is down the hall/short staircase and is shared; this wasn't an issue for us, but worth noting. The location is perfect - you are steps from so many attractions, restaurants, freedom trails, Delicious Italian food, and even transit to get around Boston. Great value and strongly recommended. :)\n",
            "- What a wonderful place to stay. The room is fantastic with AC/fridge, Keurig coffee maker and more. Even has a place to just sit on the sofa and relax. Bed is very comfortable. Hosts are wonderful! If you need anything just ask. Beth is so pleasant, kind, & knowledgeable. Sharing a bathroom wasn't a problem either. Laid back and comfortable atmosphere is so great after spending an exciting day doing and seeing so much. Location is AMAZING!! Minutes from anywhere. If it wasn't for traffic, airport is only 7 min away. We will definitely go back to see Boston and without a doubt, we will go back to see Beth and her husband. Thanks Beth! We miss you & Boston already. \n",
            "- Beth's place was wonderful. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, charming and cozy, and we really appreciated the coffee maker and complimentary water bottles! Beth's warmth and attention to detail made our stay very relaxing and enjoyable. The location was great for getting around the city. We'd come back in a heartbeat!\n",
            "- The location is perfect, the room is cozy, and the hosts treat you like family. I could not have had a better experience in Boston. This apartment really is in the heart of the North End, and is easily reachable by foot from anywhere in Boston. We like to walk, so perhaps we were a little more willing than others to do so, but we even reached it by foot after a stroll home from Cambridge. The room and shared bathroom are spotless, there is complimentary water, tea, and coffee, and the hosts make themselves available as much as needed or wanted. I have nothing but positive things to say about our stay here.\n",
            "- We felt very wellcome. Beth was friendly and helpfull. The location was super, in the middle of little Italy.\n",
            "The room was complete. With everything we needed. A coffemachine, a toaster, fresh water. We even got fresh fruits and yoghurts.\n",
            "The only thing we didn't like was the fact we hardly could see any daylight. We couldn't open a window. There was airco,but we felt a little locked.\n",
            "We missend a dustbin in the room.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Thank you, Beth for a wonderful stay in the North End of Boston.  We loved your graciousness and attention to details and making us feel welcome.  We are grateful for this alternative accommodation to pricey hotels in the area and loved Boston - can't wait to visit again!\n",

            "- Our stay with Beth was great! The whole place was super clean. Beth is very responsive to any concerns that you may have and addresses them immediately. There is a shared bath with one other guest room. We did not have any issues using it when needed though. The space is located in a community center on a small street. We were not there during services, so we had no issues coming and going when needed. Beth gives you a key and you can feel free to come and go. The location was amazing to the north end. We were within minutes walking distance from everything in town. The only thing we had trouble with was parking. You will have to find a lot down by the harbor. Look to pay around $35-$40 per day. I would recommend this place for location and cleanliness.\n",
            "- Fabulous hosts, fantastic location and comfortable and well appointed property....if you're coming to Boston, you shouldn't even think about another property--this is the best! The property is just as listed and has everything you need to feel at home away from home. The surrounding neighborhood is lovely, walkable, just down the street from Whole Foods and right around the corner from the green and orange lines of the T. We were in town for a Sox game and to meet friends (who grew up in Boston) and even they were impressed with the location and apartment. Our hosts were incredibly gracious, responsive and provided everything we needed. They thought of everything and even the directions from the Airport were spot on! Don't hesitate...book now! Gerald and Joyce, thank you, we'll definitely be back when we're next in Boston!\n",
            "-  the apartment is lovely and located next to fenway park, a supermarket and the newer part of the city centre. we loved to stay there. gerald was very nice and asked often if we need any help. we can definitly recommend the apartment.\n",
            "- Gerald had excellent communication via the website as well as a note in the apartment. Although I did not need to contact him, he left me his cell phone just in case. The instructions were clear and concise for entering the apartment. The description from the listing was very accurate. Once we entered the apartment, the look and feel met and exceeded our expectations. The apartment is nicely furnished with a combination of classic and modern interior design. It is clean, well kept and maintained. The location of this listing was excellent. We were able to walk within minutes to Boylston to shop and eat. The \"T\" station is also within a short walk. The neighborhood was beautiful, clean and safe. Thank you very much Gerald. \n",
            "- I had a wonderful stay of over a week at the apartment.  I chose the apartment because of its excellent location, price and appearance, and I couldn't have been happier.\n",
            "\n",
            "When I arrived, the entry was extremely easy (lockbox, and a small building with only a few apartments) and the A/C was already going (very grateful for the good A/C since the week I was there it was in the high-90s!).  The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and exceptionally well-outfitted with everything one could need: more than enough dishes, cookware, glasses, towels, etc.  I found it to be perfect for one person, but two people would be very comfortable as well.  I appreciated the dining room table (for some reason, many apartments lack a nice table to eat at) and the views of the Prudential Building from the bedroom.  The wifi worked well during my entire stay and was easy to connect to, and I found the bed comfortable, sleeping very well there.  I was thrilled to find the washer and dryer in the basement too.  I hardly ever heard neighbors even coming or going, and it almost felt as though I had the building to myself since I only ran into someone else once during my stay.\n",
            "\n",
            "The location is truly ideal: it's a lively yet quiet area with a lot of students, and a lot of restaurants to grab dinner or takeout.  There are a supermarket and drugstore just down the street, and you are a very short walk from Newbury St, Copley Square, Fenway Park, and the Esplanade.  To me, Boston is a walking city, so I didn't use the T or cabs, but it would be easy to access either.  I feel like it's very safe, I was out at night a few times and felt fine walking around alone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, Gerald was exceptionally responsive before and during my stay.  He replied to any questions immediately and kindly, and I felt very secure that should I run into any issues he would be available to help.\n",

            "I truly enjoyed my stay and loved having a home in Boston for a week - I hope to return someday soon!\n",
            "- We were extremely happy here. Communication was good, the apartment was very nice, and arrangements with the key were extremely convenient. The location was ideal for us. We enjoy walking and walked to North End, Boston Commons, Boylston St (extremely close), Fenway, and Cambridge. My event was at Hynes Convention Center, which is only 5 minutes or so walking. Subway is also easily accessible, as is an airport shuttle that goes to/from Hynes Conv Center. Internet connectivity is good.\n",
            "- The location was very convenient for getting around the city - we did lots of walking & found everything easy to reach. Whilst the apartment was comfortable we were disappointed with the bed which was creaky & seemed pretty old - every time one of us turned over the other was woken up. Also, outside the bedroom in the small laneway the opposite buildings have very loud airconditioning plants which run day & night creating a constant drone. To add to the noise there were garbage trucks in the laneway every morning between 6-7am which woke us up. Obviously the hosts have no control over this noise but guests should be aware of it. Key collection was very efficient & all email interaction with Gerald was very easy & concise. \n",
            "- We didn't actually meet Gerald but he explained where to access the keys and was available by phone for any queries. The apartment was beautifully decorated, warm and luxurious and a very safe neighbourhood close to restaurants, parks and shopping. Our only disappointment was that the TV was not connected as expected.\n",
            "- We were very pleased with this rental.  Not only was the apartment quite like its description, but it was also very well located for our purposes.  It was well equipped, convenient and pleasant.  We were able to walk almost everywhere that we wanted to go for culture and entertainment and it was close to a good super market.  Gerald was a perfect host, even checking in with us during our stay to see if we needed anything.\n",
            "- Gerald's apartment was in a great location for our week long visit to Boston. The apartment itself has a nice layout, a full refrigerator and kitchen for saving money while in Boston. Gerald was very responsive to our texts and helped us figure out the heating. We had a nice balance between having support and having privacy. Plus you can arrive and depart on a flexible schedule which removes much of the stress of travel and mass transit unknowns. We would definitely book with Gerald again when returning to Boston.\n",
            "- From the moment I requested to stay at Gerald's beautiful apartment the experience was wonderful!  He has great communication skills and had excellent tips about certain restaurants, tourist sites, etc.  The location couldn't have been better.  We quickly acclimated ourselves to the neighborhood and started to feel like locals.  There is a great grocery store nearby, I got my haircut at the local shop, pharmacy close, not to mention the wonderful string of bars and restaurants.  When we were tired of walking, we would take an  Uber to other parts of the city and never spent more than an $8.00 fare…  even the airport trip was only $19.00!  So, all in all, if you're gonna see Boston you can't go wrong with this charming, inviting, excellent rental!  \n",

            "which corresponded to the specified information indicqted by Airbnb\n",
            "our expectation have been more satisfied we recommand to all thid destination notd reviendrobs sabs hesitation has our next stay o Boston\n",
            "because very comfortable and very well located close to transport, restaurants and shops\n",
            "Gerald contacted our disosal to take news and to put at our disposal Thank again for its home a soon \n",
            "- Gerald's apartament is just like the pictures and the location is perfect! Just 6 minutes from the T and the BU bus station, 4 minutes from the Whole Foods and CVS, and 15 minutes from the Newbury Street and Boston Medical Center. I believe this is the best location in Boston, since it places you near to the Newbury (with its incredible stores and restaurants) but also near to the Medical Campus (if you are a student). \n",
            "The communication with Gerald was easy and he was available all the time that we needed to solve any problem, as the wifi connection that seemed not work in the beginning. The laundry is free at the basement. The kitchen is well equiped and utensils work pretty well.\n",
            "When we arrived some of the dishes seemed dirty, so we had to wash most of them again. Beside that, I would suggest to change the mattress, because when you lay in the bed it kinds of swallows you (really bad for your spine). In addition, I would suggest new knives, since the existing ones don't cut.Moreover, be aware that you'll be woken up by the garbage truck on a daily basis at 7:20 am. \n",
            "But overall, Gerald's apartament is really cozy and convenient and I would definitely come back!! \n",
            "- The apartment was clean, pretty and definitely very cozy and convenient! It was close to the Hynes T stop on the Green Line as well as Newbury Street, Mass Ave, and all the nearby universities were within walking distance. The open kitchen was very nice. Checking in and out was a breeze, and Gerald answered all my questions very quickly. Thanks for a great stay!\n",
            "- Very nice accommodation!  Perfect location for attending events at Berklee College.  Gerald was helpful and always responded right away to questions.  Parking garages are convenient.  All in all, it was a lovely experience.  Definitely want to return.\n",
            "- Very cozy and comfortable stay. Location is great! Thanks Gerald for the support and the welcome flower - it was beautiful. Parking is a little expensive but considering it's in the downtown area it is ok. Best without a car - Subway station is very close. Great neighbourhood, quiet, convenient and feels safe.\n",
            "- We enjoyed our stay here while visiting the Boston area. I agree with the previous comments that the home was exactly as described and the location was great for what we wanted to do. Gerald was quick to reply when I asked questions prior to arriving and even asked during our stay that he was available if we had questions. He was flexible and graciously honored a request we had. We have visited the city many times before so we're looking for different things to do and found a couple worth mentioning that are a quick 5 minute walk from the home- the Bodega and Mapparium. There is a T a short walk away however we used Uber and Lyft and they were readily available. The TV and Internet connection worked fine. Would recommend this place for your stay!\n",
            "- Gerald did a great job giving me instructions.  He was quickntoneespond to questions. \n",
            "\n",
            "The house is as described.bits really clean the bed is also very comfortable.  The location is great.  Really bear the T. \n",
            "\n",
            "There is a whole foods right around the corner. \n",
            "- We had a fantastic experience staying at Gerald's home! The home itself was wonderfully kept, inviting and made a great home away from home for the weekend! The location was great, it was very easy to get to the different areas of the city and there were many shops and restaurants nearby. I would recommend this listing to anyone wanting to spend some time in Boston! \n",
            "- Staying at Gerald’s place was wonderful.  He was so responsive with great directions and immediately available for any concerns I had. It was easy to find and access with a key in the lock box outside.  The location is amazing! Everyday I rode a bike from the hubway rental company (2 of them just 1 block away in either direction) to my course at the Harvard medical school and got to bike along the park.  It is very central to all kinds of things and I even made it a POPs concert at the symphony hall around the corner.  Whole foods, starbucks and lots of other cute coffee shops/restaurants are close by.  Its easy to catch public transportation to head downtown or to the waterfront.  Also as a single woman, I felt very safe getting around.  The first night I was there, there was beeping noise from the smoke detectors/carbon monoxide detector and Gerald came right away and changed the batteries.  The apartment has great wifi, a lovely seating area, good sized kitchen and very comfort bed in the bedroom.  It was great to have air conditioning in the front room which fortunately I only needed for a few hours each day and a fun above the bed in the bedroom.  I would definitely come back and stay again!  \n",
            "\n",
            "- Great place to stay when in Boston.  Couldn't ask for a better location.  The apartment was awesome.  We would definetly stay there again.  \n",
            "- Excellent neighborhood - see earlier comments since I am a newcomer to Airbnb and I was unfamiliar with the script.\n",
            "- Checkin was easy and the place was comfortable. Host is easy to contact and made things easy. The neighborhood is great walking distance to Fenway and coffee. \n",
            "- Gerald pics were spot on, the images matched the apartment perfectly. The home is very quaint and it is on the best lil street that is hidden in the midst of everything. The bed is super soft and my husband whom is very picky loved it more than The Heavenly beds at some hotels and resorts. The kitchen was well stocked with any pot/pan/dish that we could ever need. Coffee and Teas as well. We walked to Fenway each day and it was incredible ( very short walk, 10 min max) There is a parking garage at both ends of the street. However if you tell the owner your address he has a lot literally steps away that is a small triangle and you can come and go as you please. Just ask the owner at the garage for the small triangle lot if you drive off of your street, it is so great. If I am ever in Boston again I would be so happy to stay here. Gerald was so gracious, I could contact them any time during my stay and I could have received help if needed. I never needed anything but it was a comfort to know that if I did I had a contact. Helped me with all my questions and concerns right away. SAFE beautiful neighborhood with a quite street and simply quirky and quaint decor that you find very relaxing as if you were staying with family.\n",

            "- The area is perfect for walking everywhere around Boston especially good for Berklee college of music that our daughter was attending. The apartment is a good size exactly as it looks in the photos and great air-con which was good as it was extremely hot in Boston the week we stayed. Gerald was extremely helpful and answered any questions we had. Would deffinately stay here again \n",
            "- The host canceled this reservation 298 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.\n",
            "- Loved the apartment! Exactly as pictured and the location could not have been better! Nicole is an excellent hostess and her apartment is so clean and cute! Would definitely stay here again if I am ever back in the area!\n",
            "- Nicole was a fantastic host and her place was perfect! We were able to meet up so that I could get a key as she was heading out of town. Her place was perfectly located to do everything that we wanted to  while visiting.  Would definitely return and hope to soon!\n",
            "- Boston's South End is one of the best neighborhoods in the city, and Nicole's apartment is in an absolute ideal location. It's one of the man adorable brick Rowe houses that are iconic for the city. It's a short Lyft ride, or walk, from the Common and Theater District. The room is perfect. The bed was super soft and the apt. had nice views of Tremont St. There were a dozen restaurants within a block or two. I highly recommend if you want an authentic Boston experience.\n",
            "- Nicole gave us all information to feel like at home in her sweet well located apartment. Tremont St offered us a lot of opportunities to enjoy shopping and eating. We often biked with the Hubway bicycles located near her apartment which was very convenient and fun.\n",
            "The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. We enjoyed the nice views from all the windows located along Tremont St.\n",
            "- This was a super cozy apartment along a bustling street in South Boston.  Nicole was extremely helpful and very willing to provide info on what to do, where to go and how to get there.  \n",
            "I walked around both day and night and felt completely at ease in this charming, trendy neighborhood. Chinatown was a ten minute walk, multiple food options here. Bus and metro are easily walkable from here, lots of Ubers as well - this is a great place to call home as you visit and explore Boston!\n",
            "- Traveling to Boston for the marathon, our primary criteria was proximity to the finish line. Nicole's apartment fit our needs perfectly! The apartment was organized, clean, and her roommate was very polite and helpful. We were pleased with the restaurant options nearby and enjoyed how quiet the room was, allowing quality sleep. The bed is very comfortable.\n",
            "\n",
            "We would definitely stay here again in the future and would highly recommend it to others!\n",
            "- Nicole's apartment was really nice, clean and in a great location! Right in the South End and what I needed and her roommate was really nice and it felt just like being at home. Only minor issue was Nicole wasn't very clear on the checking in process and getting the key and was a bit hard to get in touch with. In the end I figured it out on my own but would've been nicer/easier if it was more clear to begin with and if Nicole was more available to get a hold of. Other than that no complaints and would happily stay here again if I needed somewhere to stay in Boston! \n",
            "- We didn't have a chance to see Nicole, but the apt is extremely comfortable. We was enjoyed staying there and will come again when living in Boston!\n",
            "- This was easily one of the best experiences my girlfriend and I have had with Airbnb.  Nicole was an excellent host, always quick to respond to any messages/questions we had and really made sure we had everything we needed.  The place itself is gorgeous, very clean, and in a very nice neighborhood, there are tons of little restaurants, shops, bars, to keep us plenty busy.  We could've spent the few days we were in town solely exploring the neighborhood alone.  I highly recommend this listing for anyone staying in Boston for a brief period, I will definitely try to stay here again if/when I do return.\n",
            "- Great place to stay in Boston. Had the pleasure of meeting Nicole on our first night and she was very helpful throughout the entire stay. Very close to tons of restaurants and not too far from the Historic sites and Fenway. \n",
            "- Nicole was great at communicating. The place was so easy to find and get into, I had no trouble. She is very accomodating. The neighborhood is safe and well located\n",
            "- Vera is a perfect host! Super friendly and helpful! The weather is so nice during our visit in Boston and this room is exactly as described. The location is unbeatable: 1min walk to both green line and orange line T stations and a lot of scenic spots are just within walking distance. This has been a perfect place to stay while visiting Boston. The room is lovely and comfortable, everything meets my expectation. I will definitely come back again if I have the chance to visit Boston next time!\n",
            "- Nice neighborhood, I like to talk a walk in the morning/after dinner to feel the summer breeze of Boston. It locates in the center of boston, very convenient, with the walking distance to anything you need, or public transportation (save you $$ on the rental cars!) , yet you don't hear the noise at all.

Her place was impeccable and decorated beautifully.   Vera is very detailed oriented in her amenities, if you forgot something she pretty much had it.  She was extremely responsive to suggestions for the area and constantly checked up on us to ensure that we were having a great experience.  Her place was centrally located and had easy access to anything that you could imagine in Boston.  I would definitely recommend staying with Vera on your trip to Boston.  I know the next time we travel to the area, I will be hoping she is not booked.  Thank you Vera for your hospitality,  we had an amazing time.  \n",

We weren't exactly sure which room/bathroom was ours at first, but as soon as I figured it out everything was fine. There were lots of snacks in the living room she welcomed us to. And she allowed us to use the TV in the 1/2 bedroom in the evening. The neighborhood is beautiful and close to the T. We enjoyed our stay very much! \n",
            "- We absolutely loved staying in Vera's place. I already recommended my sister to book this apartment because we had the best experience. The neighborhood is quite lovely and the apartment was very comfortable and charming. We were 10 minutes away (walking distance) from Berklee, where my son was staying. As far as location, it can't get any better. Vera was also very welcoming and warm. We were surprised with sweet treats and infused cold water every day and we felt very comfortable and at ease sharing her space with her. The place looks exactly like the pictures. It's incredibly cute!!\n",
            "- Vera is a great host! We enjoyed our stay at her place and Boston a lot. The apartment makes people feel at home. The neighborhood is great too. It is convenient to go to almost everywhere. And Vera is really helpful. She knows where to find delicious food in the city. Five star stay, no doubt:D\n",
            "- Vera was a great host. We added a 5th member onto our party last minute & she was more than accommodating to our situation. The location was easy to find & there was plenty to do around. Our group often split off from each other & she was more than happy to buzz in the group without the key & was very friendly the whole time. The place was clean & as advertised. She gave helpful advice for places to eat & visit. Would highly recommend to stay here when in Boston.\n",

It's a nice modern style apartment.  Behind the curtains you can walk into a garden oasis.  Everything was clean and well thought out.  There is a a private parking spot in right in front of the place.  I would stay at her place any time I come back to Boston.  \n",
            "- Katarzyna was an incredible host to us! :) We arrived late at night and she was so welcoming and showed us around the neighborhood. She took us for a drive by the beach to point out interesting places for us to see. The apt itself is actually way nicer than the pictures!! Everything is very new and convenient. It is the perfect size for a couple! She has a beautiful garden that we had access from our room. It was so nice to wake up and sit outside with a cup of coffee! \n",
            "The area was perfect for us because we wanted to be relatively close to Logan Airport (only 15 min away perfect for early flights!) but also have easy access to the city.

Katarzyna was responsive to my inquiry about staying, and then communicated well leading up to my stay so that checking in was a breeze, including messaging me when the previous guests checked out early so I could drop my bag off early! The apartment is very close to the Andrews stop on the T, and people I passed on the street were friendly and warm.  Also, delicious Polish food nearby.  \n",

Would definitely stay here again.\n",

            "- This was our first Airbnb experience and these hosts made it even more enjoyable and pleasant. Kasia and Adrian were phenomenal hosts during our stay in Boston. Their home was very cozy. They made check-in very easy and both welcomed us upon arrival. Meeting them was an absolute pleasure; they were very genuine and accommodating. They even went out of their way and offered to give us a small  tour around downtown Boston. Beyond that, they had the apartment fully furnished and livable with snacks and water in the fridge and a few microwaveable meals. \n",

            "- Kasia was a great host and her place was so perfect for our trip to Boston. The location is so close to the T making it easy to commute anywhere in the city. The location was also far enough from the busy heart of Boston that we were able to enjoy some peace and quite. Kasia was quick to respond to our needs and was kind when I accidentally set off the smoke detector when cooking bacon one morning!  The apartment has clearly been remodeled to accommodate travelers, she makes excellent use of the space with modern furnishings. The only negative thing for us was that the bed was too hard for our taste, which made our nights pretty restless. \n",

            "- BEAUTIFUL apartment. I'll admit, when looking at some of the photos, I wasn't sure if the space was going to be as nice as some of the photos portrayed and as the other reviews claimed. BUT, this location blew me away. VERY CLEAN. Beautifully renovated. It says one bed, but I comfortably slept on the sofa (I'm a 5'11\" man), while my business colleague took the bed. Location is about 10 minute drive from downtown and about 20-25 minutes from Harvard/Cambridge/Brookline area. I'd definitely stay here again.\n",
            "- The private downstairs apartment was great for staying close to the city. Katarzyna was an excellent host, providing everything that was stated on the website. She was very friendly and gave us plenty of privacy during our stay. The apartment was very cozy and the parking space was perfect. We enjoyed our stay here in South Boston! The apartment also has a lot of storage space for your belongings. I would recommend this to anyone looking to save some money but still wishes to lodge close to the city. \n",
            "- Katarzyna was an awesome host. She was there to welcome us and show us around as soon as we got to the apartment. The place was very tidy and very clean.

If I ever go to Boston again to visit then I'd definitely stay here. \n",
            "- Kasia was an excellent host(and great at communicating!) and her place was perfect for our weekend stay.

We would definitely stay again if we needed to stay in Boston again. \n",
            "- Katarzyna was a great host!  Felt welcomed and she very accommodating.  I was able to check in much sooner due to my early flight and my guest was able to check out later due to her flight.  The apartment was clean and she was readily available whenever I had questions. The apartment is 5 mins walking distance to the RedLine which leads you to all public transportation.  7 mins walking distance to Carson beach and the ocean.  Perfect location if you enjoy running as Castle Island is less than 3 miles away. And the backyard is a perfect little getaway as well!\n",
            "- The space was very quaint and had nice modern minimal design to it. Great storage spaces if you are staying long and the back yard was beautiful. The night is is so quite, like dead silent quite and we did have an early morning wake up call one morning due to residence above us moving around.\n",
            "It was great being close to the T maybe a 5 minute walk which made it easy to get around w/o a car. Also an Uber ride to another spot in town is between $5-$10, great location!  \n",

            "Could not fault any part of the appartment itself or the host and really had a great time here. \n",
            "It is slightly out from Central Boston (which is what we wanted) but is a trip on the T or a $10-15 taxi ride. \n",

I would recommend it highly!!\n",

            "- Excellent place. Kat is a great host who made the experience seamless. The apartment is only one block from the redline so easy to get around the city. It is modern and the backyard is nice (although the weather was rainy so could not enjoy it but still pleasant to look at). Definitely a nice place to stay in Boston. \n",
            "- Katarzyna was a wonderful host and so was her apartment! We came in for my college graduation and she greeted us with a cute card on the counter and even a little gift! The apartment is modern, the area is safe, and the Andrew train station on the red line is only a five minute walk away! She also has a beautiful garden which we didn't sit in  because it was a little chilly, but we really enjoyed the view of it! Overall one of my most pleasant airbnb experiences and would stay again in a heartbeat!\n",
            "- Kasia's apartment was the perfect base for our 4 day trip to Boston.  Only minutes from Andrew T station then 15 minutes to the centre of town.  The area is quiet and there is a great Polish deli and a lovely Polish cafe a few yards away.\n",

            "- Very good find for our Boston vacation. If you plan on doing any driving while in Boston this place is great because you have a parking spot. The apartment was clean, quiet, and just what expected. Katarzyna was a great host and very responsive. The location is a short distance from downtown and many of the top tourist attractions and restaurants we visited. \n",
            "- Exactly what we were looking for / needed. The beautiful backyard was an added bonus.\n",
            "- The space was very comfortable, clean and attractive for our 3 night stay in Boston. Literally a 5 minute walk to the \"T\" (Boston's subway) which takes you everywhere you would want to go and is the best travel option. Take my advice and don't drive places as you may hit traffic going downtown, and parking is expensive. The backyard garden is a nice bonus and was a peaceful  place to eat breakfast. Even though the location may appear to be on the outskirts of Boston, don't be fooled - we were able to get everywhere we wanted to go easily and quickly; not to mention South Boston itself is a cool place to explore. We had full privacy and when we had any questions they were answered within minutes by messaging. Experience was so positive we would return to this apartment and host. \n",
            "- The place is really nice and quiet, the neighborhood is great and very convenient. My girlfriend and I spent a great time at Boston. We definitely recommend this apartment\n",
            "- My Dad stayed at Katarzyna's sweet airbnb for four nights and absolutely loved it. The space itself was compact, clean, comfortable, and functional, and the garden was a great bonus. Katarzyna and her husband were helpful and welcoming -- they made my Dad feel right at home, gave him advice on scenic walks along the shoreline just a few blocks away, and helped him figure out the TV. The location is great too, just a few blocks away from the Andrews T stop on the red line. Couldn't have been better! Thank you! \n",
            "- We had a great trip to Boston and found that this was just the right home for us to stay in. So clean and the host was so nice! She also let us use one of her parking spots. It's walking distance to the T which is great for getting around. We will definitely be back!\n",

            "- Katarzyna is an amazing host. She did everything to make me feel at home right from the start. Short after my arrival she offered me to go to a large supermarket with her car. Afterwards she drove me around showing me the neigbourhood and nice places I could visit. That was so very kind. She and her husband went on vacation shortly after, but nevertheless Katarzyna contacted me a few times to see if everything still  was OK or if I needed anything. \n",
            "The apartment is great, exactly as is shown in the pictures. Everything is quite new and of good quality. Wifi is solid and very fast.\n",
            "I highy recommend this place and Katarzyna as host.\n",
            "- Katarzyna is very nice and communicates well to keep you informed. The accommodations are very European. I would have appreciated hand towels and face clothes, but the bath towels worked. The bed mattress is firm and comfortable. The sofa set has a pull out that makes it a comfortable bed also. We used Uber and Lyft to get around Boston and no one had trouble finding her place. Many restaurants make deliveries in that area. We enjoyed our stay. \n",
            "- Great place... Perfect for 2 (and perhaps a third like small child). The unit was completely renovated... Like walking into Ikea... Super clean, very nice and the neighborhood is safe. I'd stay here again without hesitation. With one parking space for you, it truly is a great place. \n",
            "\n",
            "Katarzyna is a gracious host giving us great city advice and also offered her small backyard to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n",
            "- We stayed for two nights in Boston and we are so glad to stumble upon Katarzyna's place on airbnb! She was very accommodating and gave us tons of information on the surrounding area. She even accommodated an early check in time which was very helpful since we had arrived on red eye flight from California. Very charming, quiet, and private space. Perfect for two people and was a great place to come home to at the end of the day. I'm definitely looking forward to returning to Boston and staying here again!\n",
            "- My wife and I recently returned from a five night stay in Boston. After a long drive, check in at Katarzyna's was easy and she quickly came to greet us and ensure we had everything we needed upon arrival. The electronic locks on the doors made access easy and secure without having to worry about keys. There is a parking space for a small car, which is a huge plus as parking is challenging to find in Boston. \n",
            "\n",
            "The apartment was clean, and as shown in the pictures. There was clean bedding and towels prepared. The bed and linens were comfortable and of hotel quality. My wife loved the quilt on the bed. The bathroom was clean and nicely renovated. \n",
            "\n",

            "We felt safe in the neighbourhood. The apartment is a five minute walk to the Andrew red line T stop, which can have you into the city and surrounding area in less than 20 minutes. There are some excellent pizza restaurants close by, and a great Polish restaurant that is worth trying. \n",
            "\n",
            "While in the city our car was broken into, however nothing was stolen or damaged. I would not leave valuables in the vehicle and would ensure you lock your car. That being said, at no point did we feel unsafe or suspect that we were in an unsafe neighbourhood during our trip. \n",

            "- Our stay at Kasia's place was wonderful. She was very accommodating to our arrival and departure time. Throughout our stay, she messaged us a few times and make sure we were well taken care of. The house is clean and cozy. The neighborhood is nice and only a few blocks away from restaurants, donuts, and the bus and subway station. We loved the place and look forward to returning one day.\n",
            "- Small and cozy apartment on a quiet street. Very nice owner. Perfect for our trip to Boston. Since we spent so much time exploring Boston, all we needed was an air-conditioned place to sleep. We'll definitely be staying there again!\n",
            "- Bel appartment avec jolie cour à l'arrière. Idéal pour un couple. Situé à quelques pas du métro. Le quartier est cependant un peu moche donc soyez conscient que vous chercher sans doute à ne pas trop y passer de temps. \n",
            "- Really nice place with plenty of room and a really nice garden in a good neighbourhood. 5 minute walk to to T and access to all of Boston. The public transport was really good and we found it very easy to get around the city. \n",

            "- I will try my best to capture in words the absolutely amazing experience my husband and I had.  We feel so lucky to have stayed in Julie's Treetop Haven, which lives up to its name with the nature we experienced right outside the windows!\n",
            "\n",
            "Julie was so kind and very easy to communicate with.  She quickly responded to all my messages and even checked to make sure all was well during our stay.  Julie went above and beyond to make our stay magical.  We were in town for our sister-in-law's wedding and we were also celebrating our 14th anniversary.  Julie left us a gorgeous handmade flower arrangement, a sweet card, delicious chocolates, wine, and little snacks.  She also gave us amazing coffee from her Keurig and even asked what kind of creamer I like, leaving organic nondairy creamer to accommodate my lactose intolerance.  So amazingly kind!  \n",
            "\n",
            "As far a location is concerned, Julie's home is in a super safe neighborhood where we felt comfortable walking around at night.  It's a 5 minute walk to a gorgeous arboretum, a 10 minute walk to the  Green St. T station (it's about a 20 minute ride into downtown Boston), and a 10 minute walk to all the downtown JP goodness.  We loved spending time in JP with all the great places to eat.  Our favorites were Fiore's for breakfast, City Feed and Supply for groceries and lunch, and JP Licks for dessert.  Everything you need is walking distance in town, from a dry cleaners to drug store to a grocery store.  There is a great farmer's market on Thursday afternoon.  The JP Pond is also worth a visit.  I would love to live in JP! \n",
            "\n",
            "Julie's home is clean and comfortable, with beautiful artifacts from all her world travels.  I loved coming \"home\" from our daily adventures.  The air conditioning works very well, the claw foot bathtub is to die for, and the bed is extremely comfortable!  We appreciated the awesome closet unit in the bedroom, with tons of drawer space and room to hang our nice clothes.  Julie's relaxation room is heaven and there is so much beautiful natural light in every room.  You will love the tree in the front yard.  In the mornings, I took my coffee to the living room windows and just watched all the squirrels and birds frolic and eat.  Being on the second floor was perfect for observing the nature.   \n",

            "- This was a clean, comfortable, and relaxing place to stay. The apartment was walking distance from great shops and restaurants, as well as nice outdoor green spaces. Julie was a fantastic host and was very thoughtful and accommodating with our needs. We loved the thoughtful touches like the flowers and the welcome basket. The small TV room was big enough to use as a second bedroom for our 1-year old's travel crib, so there was more than enough space. We thoroughly enjoyed or stay and would highly recommend this place to others! \n",
            "- Julie's place was fantastic.  She had wine, coffee and chocolates waiting for me on my arrival.  Clean doesn't cover how spotless her place was...better than any 5 star hotel I have stayed in.  Her part of Jamaica Plains is fantastic...kind of a hipper area.  Plenty of cool restaurants nearby within walking distance and the T is only about a 10-15 minute walk.  Street is very quiet and neighbors didn't make a peep.  Would definitely stay again.\n",
            "- This was a true find! Julie is a warm and attentive host. I arrived to fresh flowers, a card and welcome basket of delicious goodies. Julie made herself accessible at all times to meet any needs and answer any questions. She made a point of making sure that I was comfortable and had everything that I needed. Her home is beautiful, bright, spotless and uncluttered. Each unit in the building has its own set of clothes washers and dryers located in the basement which was wonderful since I was there for 10 nights with a limited wardrobe. The kitchen is fully equipped and really well organized. Her home provided me a wonderful sanctuary to return to at the end of each day. Each morning I woke to the sounds of birds singing and a sense of tranquility. The location is very accessible. Shopping and restaurants are within a couple of blocks. The arboretum and Jamaica Pond are also just blocks away. I had a car which I parked in Julie's driveway, off street parking is a very nice perk. That said I could get just about everywhere I wanted to go without having to drive. It was a truly lovely find! \n",
            "- Our first Airbnb experience at Julie’s home was perfect! My wife and I have lived in Jamaica Plain for many years and we recently needed a short term housing solution while renovation work took place in our home. We wanted a quiet, private place right near the center of JP. Julie’s home was perfect and the process was seamless from start to finish. Julie is a terrific host, very kind and responsive. We arrived to a beautiful and extremely clean apartment, and she’d left behind a gift basket with flowers, chocolate and other goodies. We felt comfortable and at home during our twelve night stay, which we extended part way through. The home is on a very nice, quiet street close to restaurants, shops, the Arnold Arboretum and public transportation. Access to laundry and off street parking was a huge bonus. As other reviews have mentioned, it is very quiet, which was great. We were kind of dreading living in a temporary situation for two full weeks, but I don’t think it could have been any better. I would give Julie and her home the highest recommendation and will tell out-of- town visitors about it moving forward.  \n",

            "The house was perfectly comfortable and the neighbors were always incredibly friendly.\n",
            "Also, if you are into cooking, this place had absolutely everything one might ever need for cooking. Seriously, one of the most complete kitchens I have ever seen! \n",
            "When we got there she had her signature flowers and a basketful of treats for us and the baby (even bubbles for him to play with!), and was incredibly supportive throughout our stay. At one point the microwave there died, and she helped us get a new one in no time. \n",
            "Overall we fell in love with her place and came to have it feel very much like home. When we visit Boston again we hope to go back to her haven!\n",

            "I was a bit concerned about previous reviews that mentioned that the place was not clean. That was not my impression at all! the house, room, and bathroom are very clean, and Robert has a helper who helps him keep the place very clean. \n",

            "- I stayed with Robert at the beginning of May and truly enjoyed his great hospitality. Robert's place is all about location, you just can't beat it! The house is on a quiet street in a beautiful Victorian neighborhood located in the very center of Boston. Local attractions are within walking distance and it's a 3min walk to Back Bay T station and less than 10 min ride downtown. Restaurants, bars and a shopping mall are at your doorstep. Robert is an excellent host, very helpful and accommodative. Jackie helped me to carry bags up the staircase and when I was down in NYC Robert did store my bigger suitcase. Overall a great experience and I would definitely stay again.     \n",
            "- The room was clean and Robert was full of valuable information that helped me navigate the city. His home is located in a beautiful neighborhood and is surrounded by amazing food and drink. \n",

            "Would stay again! \n",
            "- Robert has an exceptional home - absolutely beautiful neighborhood that is centrally located to the train station, restaurants and shops. \n",
            "I recommend Roberts place for future AIRBNBers.\n",
            "- Perfectly located, great host communication and a bargain! Would even stay here if rate slightly increased and a little more was invested in cleaning it like a hotel, they supplied a window a/c unit and got a new mattress. It wasn't dirty by any means, just a little dustier than a typical place you'd rent and hot when temps are above 70. \n",
            "- I have been warm wellcomed by Jacky, who has showed me around and gave me good advices where to go. We talked a lot about music as well :) \n",

            "- Just in to Boston for one day - I had never been to Boston. It was a great place to stay. Perfect for what I needed.\n",
            "- The house was in a nice neighborhood very centrally located to the Back Bay Station. I felt very safe walking back home late at night. Jacky welcomed me and was very flexible about check in time, which made it much easier to plan. The room was clean and he provided a clean towel. He also was very helpful with providing a map and helping to explain how to get to my destination in town.\n",
            "However, I was checked into a room that I did not book, but rather the ground level floor room.\n",
            "The room described here is \"filled with light\" and on the \"third floor\". The room I was checked into was the ground floor room, which was very dark, even with the curtains open and smelled very musty, (since it was on the ground floor of a brownstone).\n",
            "I would have preferred it if the hosts contacted me beforehand telling me the room was not available anymore and asking if i was ok to switch rooms. \n",
            "Jacky was apologetic, when I brought up the fact that I was not in the room that I booked and refunded me the difference in price of the two rooms, but if given the choice, I would have simply booked a room in another location.\n",

            "- Robert's place was a real treat to stay in. You can tell you're in the home of a professor when the books are stacked from floor to ceiling, and follow you up the stairs. I loved checking out the interesting titles on the spines and seeing the great historical items all around the house. The room was exactly as pictured, you'd think he took the photo moments before I booked! The room was spacious and tidy, with a lovely view of the tree-lined street. Plenty of room to relax, write, or whatever else you might need. There is an AC in the room, though you have to keep the window open because its quite recessed into the window well, so it takes a few minutes to cool down (though once it did I was more than comfortable). \n",
            "\n",
            "There are other rooms for rent here, so you may run into other boarders, though I only caught a glimpse of a fellow traveller while I was there on my short stay. You will share a bathroom, which was large and clean, with any other boarders. Since I was there for such a short time, I only saw a little of Robert as well, but I found he and his housemate very welcoming and helpful. The house is centrally located in the Back Bay area and easy to get to cafes, shopping, and not too far from the subway. It is in a rather historic and posh neighborhood, so you may have to travel a bit to get to more low-fi or indie happenings, but I didn't find that to be too difficult. Great neighborhood for walking and exploring, great spot for a cozy yet refined stay. \n",
            "- Great location near the subway.  Large room.  Robert gave me a list of available things to do in Boston.\n",
            "- Lovely furnishings as accurately pictured in the photos.\n",
            "However, besides the bed and linens themselves, everything was dirty: the rugs, carpets, desk and horizontal surfaces dusty, visual brown stains on the couch and chairs - mold and mildew on the community shower/bath mat in the bathroom. If you are a teenager, college student or male in your 20's all this might be okay w/ you. As a female grown up, it was gross. Also: security - no locks on the doors, not even the community bathroom door! Window to fire escape left wide open in the bathroom - anyone could have crawled in. Noisy A/C unit, creaky bed. Upside: 1. had full range of cable channels, 2 it was quiet and 3 Doug who met me and showed me to my room was nice. And again, very cool, antiquey furnishings. I'm okay w/ \"funky\" I'm just not okay w/ \"filthy\". \n",
            "- It was a great experience to live at Robert's place. His place is so close to the city center that everywhere is easily to reach by walking. Robert would give really good tourist guide around the city so you won't miss anything fantastic in Boston. It is also wonderful to get to stay in one of the oldest house in Boston downtown and get to see Robert's great collection of books. I would like to stay there again in my future trips.\n",
            "- The place, the neighborhood is perfect, near Metro, supermarket, calm, beautiful, central..... The house is a little beat old, but very interesting. Jack and Robert were very friendly and kindly, thank you. Really only one bathroom to 4 rooms and without a key in the door is not so confortable (and the window is open direct to street too and only with a slim dark web). The bed in our big room was very noise and not so confortable, so we put the mattress on the floor and so we were able to sleep very well. All furniture is classic in the room, with carpet and with little spideweb in the ceiling - not good to allergic people. It was a pleasant sojourn. But the entrance, the bathroom (good water), the stairs (it`s not easy, a little hard, smal and high) and the bedroom, they were the house parts that we can see there. The door in entrance is very narrow - to us it was not a problem, but to big luggages or obese person it can be difficult. It`s a good place to stay.\n",
            "- Excellent place to stay in Boston. Wonderfully quiet neighborhood, right by the financial district which means easy access to fine restaurants and shopping. Close to Back Bay station for the metro. The house has the wonderful smell of old books, and has a character few places possess. Room was fantastic, bed a bit creaky, but comfortable. Bathroom was great. \n",

            "- Great location (2 1/2 short blocks from the T), first rate accommodations.  Comfortable, clean and quiet.  Loved the flexible check in/check out times.  Absolutely would stay with Robert (and Jackie, who welcomed me) again.\n",
            "- Robert was very helpful and I enjoyed staying in his place very much.  It is well located and lots of space, a TV, and comfortable bed.  You are a block away from the subway, lots of shopping, cafes, the Boston Public Library, and everything you need.  Robert is an insightful, knowledgeable host, and he has so much information at his finger tips.  I learned a great deal from him about places to go, but also about the history of the area, how to get around, and so on.  I have no complaints about the way I was treated and would not hesitate to stay here again. \n",
            "- Très bon accueil et agréable séjour. La maison est calme et situé au vieux centre de Boston, pas loin du Back Bay Stn, donc facile pour visiter la ville et ressortir le soir. Maison meublé de livres, donc pas de problèmes de lecture. Hôte très accueillant et donne bons conseils pour visites. Cartes touristiques dispos dans la chambre. Pas de petit déjeuner sur place et quelques chambres partagent une salle de bains, mais pas un problème majeur.\n",
            "- The room was nice and cozy.  Robert Bonds was a wonderful person to deal with.  I would stay there again.\n",
            "- Robert and Jiaqi were wonderful hosts.  I was in town for work M-F and can honestly say there is no way you can experience Boston this inexpensively.  If you're every in town, look Robert up!\n",
            "- A beautiful room in a lovely and very full home! Robert gave me great information on what the city had to offer when I arrived and after that I didn't see anyone. The location was fantastic!\n",
            "- Really interesting house, my room was really quiet and spacious.. Jacky, who welcomed me on my arrival, was a great source of info - gave me maps and showed me things to see and do.  Is in a top spot - near the Back Bay railway station, Copley Square, beautiful Trinity Church and Boston Library which should not be missed. Thank you.\n",
            "- Robert & Jaiqi are wonderful hosts, very gracious and engaging!  The home is ideally located in the lovely South End - convenient to public transportation, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.  The house is old and quaint, I found my bedroom and the bathroom clean.  Never did run into the guests in the other 2 rented rooms. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Boston and not wanting to spend big bucks on a hotel room.  Thank you Robert & Jaiqi!\n",
            "- Robert's location is excellent. A short walk to great shopping and tasty restaurants on Newbury Street, Copley Square, and the Back Bay T station.  He was very accommodating when my flight was delayed by 2 hours and when my travel plans shortened the length of my stay.\n",
            "- I had a wonderful stay at Robert's house. It was a bit cold. However, the location and price really make up for it. I don't think it's even possible to find a better deal in that location. The room had a couple extra blankets, which helped a lot. Also, he was very flexible with check in/ check out dates, helpful with all of my questions. It was great. Thank you.\n",
            "- It was a nice time at Robert's place during my stay in Boston. He and Jacky provided good tips in getting your way around Boston. The room was spacious and the place was located conveniently near the city center. Most of the places were accessible by foot. However hot showers may not be available whenever you want if someone has showered before you; you may have to wait an hour before the low pressure water tank warms up.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Other than that, I would recommend this place.\n",
            "- It was great staying at Robert's place. The location couldn't be beat, the room was excellent, and Robert was very flexible about check-in/check-out times.\n",
            "- Initially I was confused about the location but that was more due to my unfamiliarity with Boston. To get there from Copley Place walk indoors through the mall to the Dartmouth St entrance to Back Bay transit station. Walk straight through the station and after walking out the other end, hang a right, and Chandler St is only a short block away. \n",
            "\n",
            "Robert was teaching when I arrived, but his flatmate was able to let me in. His place is an eclectic little firetrap filled with books and various memorabilia from floor to ceiling. The accommodations were spare but comfortable and quiet. The wireless access worked fine. I only had a short chance to speak to Robert before I left the next day and wish I had had more time to talk about our shared experience in the teaching profession.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would stay again; it might accommodate 2 ppl but I think it's a better place for one person in need of just a place to be able to get a night's sleep before heading back out again. \n",
            "- The house is very attractive, the room(chamber) is big and decorated well. Very clean(appropriate), very close to the subway in a charm district. Robert is a very kind man.\n",
            "- Robert was a great host. He was able to take me in on very short notice, less than two hours. The room was comfortable and quite warm. Robert gave me a  in-depth description of what I could see and do while in Boston and told me the history of his unique house. I highly suggest booking with Robert.\n",
            "- Robert was a kind, helpful, friendly host! His place is in an excellent location--I was attending a conference at the Westin Copely Square and it was very easy to travel to and from Robert's place to the conference. The room was clean, spacious, had a TV, and I loved the decor.\n",
            "- This was my first AirBnB experience. I loved the location and its proximity to a lot of great spots. The indoor parking garage a block away was perfect as parking for the weekend was difficult. \n",
            "\n",
            "The room is great and comfortable, in particular for the price point. Its not a hotel stay (no private bathroom), bed is ok - but neither but the hosts have priced the room with that in consideration. \n",

            "I would stay there again. \n",
            "- I stayed at Robert's house while attending conference at Westin Copley hotel. \n",
            "The location is amazing. It's on a quiet street, so room is very tranquil, yet - it's in the heart of the city, with everything within short walking distance. I was getting to my conference in 6 minutes, 8 if I stopped at Starbucks. \n",
            "The room has old charm/rustic/eclectic/hard to capture feel to it. It was a bit dusty from all the books in the house (they are EVERYWHERE:)), which I didn't mind. \n",
            "\n",
            "The only substantial negative for me was that the internet, otherwise fast and reliable, is going out when someone is talking on the phone. If your work relies on uninterrupted access, make sure to warn Robert. \n",
            "\n",
            "In my opinion, room is best suited for one guest, I had a good time there alone, although a young couple might find it also pretty attractive and convenient. \n",

            "\n",
            "- Excellent location.  I was able to walk almost everywhere I wanted to go.  If too far to travel on foot, I was close to mass transit.  Shopping, dining, entertainment...all right there.  Robert also took time my first night to share places I might like to visit, taking into consideration my tight schedule.  He was quite hospitable and helpful.  \n",
            "- Robert is a very kind and considerate host. I would definitely recommend staying with him if you visit Boston.  His home is truly an ideal location to enjoy everything Boston has to offer, and he can surely offer suggestions if you need them.  The room is spacious and comfortable, and you will not be short of reading material as there are more books in Robert's home than in most high school libraries.\n",
            "\n",
            "- I'm glad Robert was able to accommodate me so last minute (an hour or so). The house itself is like a mix between old bookstore and antiquary: bookshelves and random sculptures/art in every nook and cranny (people with severe dust allergy might have some trouble; I'm mildly allergic but had no issue). The area is well located but also quiet (I stayed one Saturday night and heard no noise). I could not meet Robert but his roommate was friendly and helpful.\n",
            "- This room puts you in a great location for access to the Back Bay and South End neighborhoods of Boston. I stayed here while attending a conference at the nearby Marriott - a very close walk away. The room had wifi, a desk, and a beautiful view. I was rather busy, so my interactions with Robert and Jackie were sparse. But they seemed friendly and willing to be helpful and accommodating. There are a lot of books and statues in the stairwell leading up to the room, but the room itself is spacious. For the quality of location and low price point, it was worth the trade-off for other comforts I would have liked.\n",
            "- Robert ist ein sehr freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber, die Kommunikation lief bestens. Sein Haus liegt sehr zentral, zahlreiche Restaurants und Läden sind problemlos zu Fuß erreichbar. Das Zimmer war in Ordnung, allerdings sollte man seine Erwartungen an Hygiene und Sauberkeit etwas zurückschrauben: im ganzen Haus werden unzählige Bücher und allerlei Nippes aufbewahrt, auch der eigentliche Hauseingang ist komplett zugestellt, so dass das Gebäude nur noch durch einen Nebeneingang betreten werden kann. Das mit anderen Gästen geteilte Badezimmer war ok, die spakige Gummimatte in der Wanne hat allerdings auch schon bessere Zeiten gesehen...Die drei Sterne also vor allem für die Lage und den freundlichen Gastgeber.\n",
            "- Didn't meet Robert, but Jackie was there to welcome me. Very nice stay in a lovely old room. Back Bay is a great area of the city. Close to the station and heaps of character in this area. Highly recommended. \n",
            "- Robert was very patient and understanding as we had to change our travel plans\n",

            "The apartment is very well located in Boston and you can reach the metro station by walking 5 minutes and go Downtown by walking 20 minutes. The bedroom was clean and lovely. The bed was comfortable.\n",

            "- What great fortune to have accommodation just blocks from Copley Square! Robert graciously gave me excellent ideas for sightseeing with limited time. I felt very comfortable at his lovely, historical home!\n",
            "- Location was great.  Very close to the Back Bay subway station and there were some great restaurants around (My personal favorite was BGood, a super healthy farm fresh place).  Within walking distance to the Boston Public Garden and Commons.  Robert is super nice.  I would recommend bringing earplugs since there is an antique clock in the hallway that chimes every 15 minutes throughout the night.\n",
            "-      Great room just as pictured. You will share a bathroom with any other guests in a couple of different rooms, but I never experienced any problems or crowding even with others occupants present. There is quick access to the T metro system, as well as a convenient store (City Convenience?) that stocked any supplies you might need as well as lots of drinks, food, and snacks. Copley Square and mall are just up the road. This home's location is unbeatable!\n",
            "     Robert was informative and gave me a quick overview of the city as it was my first time there.  \n",
            "- I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this lovely room.  My room was spacious, and well-appointed with a sofa, mirror, fan, and A/C unit.  I never saw any of the other guests, and never had a problem accessing the shared bathroom when needed.  Robert was a gracious and helpful host.  The neighborhood is lovely, and close to the wedding I was attending in the Copley area.\n",

The house itself is a sweet old brownstone, and filled with tons of interesting books lining every available wall. The room is everything you need for a short stay in Boston.\n",
            "- I'm a freelance hairstylist so finding a crash pad for two days it's hard to find. Robert was soft spoken and helpful and the best part was only walking distance from my gig. \n",

            "- Exactly as described.  Robert is a patient and accommodating host.\n",
            "- Perfect location - you could not ask for better. If you are Lucky enough to stumble upon this listing don't waste any more time the location at this price is a real steal. The room was lovely clean with AC and wifi. Shared bathroom with other guests but out of three days I only had to wait once. There are a couple of flights of steep stairs which wasn't a problem for me but just a warning for less mobile people. I was helped with my bags which was lovely! Happy to recommend this place to others and if I was to return to Boston I would certainly stay again. Thanks Robert!\n",

            "- I had an amazing stay at Robert´s who gave me good advice on the places I should visit in Boston. He welcomed me well and made me feel like at home. Besides, the location of the house, in the center of the city makes it very convenient to move around. The room was nice and spacious, pretty cool and the bed was comfortable.\n",

            "- What a lovely welcoming Host! I arrived after 4 schedule changes and Robert adjusted meeting me to a mutual time. I was delighted with the quiet and very clean space he showed me. Many art objects and scholarly books were there. Robert handed me a key and perfect directions to the meeting I had scheduled. I had room to sit and read and write to friends. Wi-fi access was immediately available. Good hot water and airy sleeping space. \n",

He then provide in depth and knowledgeable information about Boston and recommended some locations and what to prioritize if I was short of time.  The room is as indicated in the photographs and was comfortable.  Robert was also flexible with arrival and departures times, which is handy. \n",

            "Overall, it was a positive experience. The bed was noisy and not the most comfortable, but passable for the price.

            "Robert's home is great--it's on a gorgeous street too--but most importantly it is in a GREAT location: we were able to walk virtually anywhere we wanted to go in downtown Boston.  Given that every other hotel in the area is extremely expensive (at least relative to my budget),Robert's place is a no-brainer. Highly recommended if you're staying in the downtown area.\n",

            "- I had a great experience staying at Robert's. He is welcoming, clear in communication, responds quickly and is very helpful and fun to talk with. The room is spacious and warm, and I was really grateful to have that while staying during the freezing Boston winter. I would definitely stay here again in the future!\n",
            "- Robert is a great host, communicative and responsive.  We would stay here again happily.  Conveniently located and reasonably priced, this is a great spot from which to explore Boston \n",
            "- Robert fue un gran anfitrión, me ayudó a planificar las visitas a la ciudad, es una persona muy amable y preocupada.\n",

            "- We are sponsoring a young musician who had auditions in Boston and the issue of where to say came up.  A hotel didn't seem appropriate for this young man, and so we turned to AirBnB, discovering Robert's perfect Back Bay bnb.  We were excited because it was close to the audition sites and reasonably priced.   In early correspondence with Robert, we sensed how perfect the fit really was -- Robert is a professor at a nearby college.  We packed our young charge off to Boston and into the middle of a blizzard.  We had to extend the stay several days, and Robert was incredibly accommodating.  We knew our young student was warm and safe in Boston until we could get him a flight out.  Our student tells us that the room is wonderful, comfortably cozy and a great place to pass snowy days, though he would liked to have toured the area more.  We booked Robert's bnb for a subsequent visit and hope to stay there ourselves someday. \n",
            "- A Fantastic stay all round! Robert was extremely helpful for a first time visitor to Boston, showed me all the places I should hit with my 48 hours and I was not disappointed! A great, quiet little place that more than did the job!!\n",
            "- The host was welcoming and helpful, but the house was a disappointment.  The host seems to be a hoarder (of books at least), as almost every space, is stacked with books and nicknacks.  The floors and bathroom were not particularly clean and there was an unpleasant odour, throughout the house. My bed wasn't great either.\n",
            "On the positive side, the quiet location is great.\n",
            "- Boston est une ville magnifique comme la maison de Robert un charme croyable \n",
            " Robert et tres prévenant et attentionné les meubles anciens la salle de bain sublime !!!\n",
            "Merci Robert a tres. Bientôt a Boston \n",
            "- Wow - what a home with a lot of history. A classic Boston brownstone about 2 blocks from a major mass transit stop (subway/bus/Amtrak). Room was spacious and included a desk, TV, couch, local maps/tourist info and wifi. Bathroom is modern and in good working order. During my stay I tried to imagine the history of this home and everyone who has passed through here. Definitely not a cookie-cutter hotel room. Staying here will make my visit to Boston even more memorable.\n",
            "- Even though I did not see a lot of person due to the fact I was so busy at my conference, my stay at Robert's was very nice. The room is comfortable and looks exactly like on the picture: a lot of decoration, a theme clearly centred on Titanic, but in a way that as soon as you enter you feel at home!\n",
            "Robert was really nice and easy-going: even though I was late due to my plane, I was still warmly welcomed, and even helped for my venue.\n",
            "The house is in a quiet neighbourhood (which is not the case everywhere in Boston), allowing quiet and restful nights (except maybe for the clock in the corridor, but when you are sleepy it does not matter that much).\n",
            "In few words: I definitely recommend you to go at Robert's :-)\n",
            "- Hello, I am Elly and I stayed 7 nights in the B and B of Robert.\n",
            "Had a wonderful time in Boston, in the beginning of May, the city looked at its best with all the trees blooming. The room is spaceous and very quiet. And so close to many \"Bostonian\" highlights. Robert is a perfect host, took a lot of time to explain where to find good restaurants and nearby \"not to miss\" places: Library, musea, Copley Square.\n",
            "I am very grateful that Robert let me stay longer in the room, because of the late departure time of my home-flight. Thank you, Robert!\n",
            "- Robert was a great host! He set the house up before arrival and assisted in anything that was necessary. He was also flexible for check out time. The house is in close proximity to public travel station, restaurants, night-life and universities.\n",
            "- Overall this all worked out pretty well. I stayed only for one night as a day trip for work. Location in Back Bay was fantastic, the room itself was sufficient. The host was accessible and knowledgable. \n",
            "- Robert's home is in a central location of the Back Bay area, only a three minute walk to an underground station and the Boston Public Library, 10 minutes walk to Chinatown and Boston Commons, 20 minutes to Fenway or North End in either direction.  Also, a nice independent coffee shop is a block in one direction (Appleton) and an affordable bar with pretty good food is a block in another direction (Delux).\n",
            "\n",
            "Robert was very nice and hospitable.  While the home itself is cluttered with lots of books and accumulated stuff, my room was nice and the bathroom was clean.  For those who may have problems with stairs, beware there are three flights of steep stairs.  Overall this was a very pleasant stay.\n",
            "- Robert (and another long-term tenant, Jackie) made me very welcome with Jackie carrying my case up the several flights of stair in Robert's charming, very original, row house.\n",
            "\n",
            "I was much assisted by Robert's tireless historical commentary on Boston and its environs. As a result I suspect I saw many highlights otherwise missed by visitors.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are many interesting eating houses, including a local café, excellent for breakfast, unchanged and unpolished, one suspects for many years.\n",
            "\n",
            "My room was very large with a bay window offering views and fresh air. I was very comfortable.\n",
            "- Although I did not see Robert much during my stay, he was kind during our brief meetings.  I appreciated his flexibility with my check in and check out times.  I enjoyed chatting with the Chinese college student, Jiaqi, who is also living in Robert's house.  Although I would have appreciated having some closet space to hang my clothes and locks on the bedroom and bathroom doors, it was a pleasant stay all the same.  The room was spacious.  The location is fantastic and the price is very reasonable considering the location.  I would recommend staying here.\n",
            "- Robert and Jacky (another guy who lives there) were being very helpful and friendly during my stay. Jacky offered to take my heavy luggage to my floor on third floor as I just arrived while Robert was waiting in my room , and we It's a old house, but the room is beautiful and cozy, and of course in a great location, only such steps from the heart of Back Bay and several T/Amtrak/commuter rail stations that you can go to almost anywhere from there. The neighborhood is very quiet too!\n",
            "- Robert and Jackie are very friendly. The location is very good.  If I go to Boston again, I want stay there.\n",
            "- Robert wasn't initially around but his assistant Jaqui greeted me very courteously and showed me to the room.  Later I met Robert and he seemed like a nice person - when it rained he even offered me an umbrella to use - very thoughtful.\n",
            "\n",
            "He also gave great directions to the home via the free airport to downtown rail service.\n",
            "\n",
            "Neighbourhood and location is absolutely first rate and beautiful.\n",
            "The room itself is exactly as pictured, however there were some issues:\n",
            " - nowhere at all to hang clothes.  I had to live out of my case - not ideal for a pressed business suit.\n",
            " - Even though the room seemed clean, there was a very strong dusty or musty smell that I couldn't clear even by leaving the windows open all the time.\n",
            " - Bed was noisy and creaky when climbing in.\n",
            " - Wifi was awful on the one night I needed it.  To be fair, this might have been a one-off, but I had an urgent need to prepare for a meeting the next day when speed decreased down to 0.01 MB/s and then shut off all together. \n",
            "\n",
            "On the plus side, the house is filled with beautiful prints and other artworks, though guests are only allowed access to the bedroom, a shared bathroom and the front door (no access to kitchen, dining, living or other room in the house)\n",
            "\n",
            "I recommend the room for brief, simple, non-business visits to the center of Boston.\n",
            "- Robert was great. ..he gave me the history of the city and what sights to see\n",
            "- I didn't meet Robert but his assistant Jacky was very helpful and accommodating. The location was brilliant, with easy transport to and from the airport, walking distance to several points of interest, good cafés and restaurants just around the corner. The bed and bathroom were both clean and comfortable. The house certainly has its eccentricities but it generally just added character!\n",
            "- Viivyin yhteensä 8 yötä Robertin luona. En tavannut Robertia, hän oli matkoilla, mutta hänen assistenttinsa Jackie oli hyvin ystävällinen ja avulias. Kaikki sujui ongelmattomasti ja mutkattomasti. Huone oli kotoisa ja riittävän siisti, vaikkakin täynnä tavaraa. Myös kylpyhuone oli siisti. Ainoa ongelma oli, että huoneessa ei ollut vaatekaappia tai telinettä vaatteille, joten jouduin ripustelemaan vaatteitani sinne ja tänne, tai säilyttämään matkalaukussa. Myös sänky oli natiseva, mikä ei tosin haitannut nukkumista. Asunnon sijainti on loistava, se on aivan keskellä Bostonia ja hyvien kulkuyhteyksien päässä.\n",
            "- The location is brilliant with many sights within walking distance. Robert is very knowledgable on the history of Boston and gave me plenty of helpful tips. All in all a great place if you don't have a long time to spend (I was only in Boston 2 nights) and want to be right in the centre. \n",
            "- Robert was very welcoming! My stay was very short, but I had a great experience and would definitely stay here again my next time in Boston.\n",
            "- Both Robert and JiaQ were home when I arrived, and were sure to show me the best places to go on my quick trip. I didn't get to interact too much with them as I was working, but both were very hospitable. I should add that they let me use their personal refrigerator . I am a working mom and it was great that they let me store some items in their refrigerator. \n",
            "- very welcoming, they gave me a full explanation on the house, suggested places to visit Boston. In general  - the location is just perfect, walking distance to the city centre and the South station. Few good restaurant just across the street and a safe neighbourhood to walk at night. The house itself is very unique and interesting with hundreds of  books - you don't want to leave our room.\n",
            "My only complain is the bed mattress - its old and uncomfortable and gave me  backpain. \n",
            "- Room is exactly as pictured.  Very old home, but just what I needed location wise.  Private room.  Shared bathroom on the floor above.  \n",
            "- I greatly enjoyed my time at Robert's home. Robert was very kind, the room was spacious and clean, and the house is located on a quiet, tree-lined street.\n",
            "- Robert and JiaQ were excellent hosts. Very accomodating and flexible with my schedule. Their place is the coolest place around. If I were offered a nice room at the Westin, I would turn it down and stay at this place instead...again...and again.  Location, location, location. AND the style of the home gives it the perfect \"Boston experience.\" \n",
            "- We truly enjoyed our Boston experience with Robert's accommodations. The room was nicely decorated and clean. Location was great, quiet street, and very close to the T so we could get around easily. Robert suggested excellent places to eat.  A gracious host!\n",
            "- Robert is a nice host.  He responded promptly to my questions and requests.  I appreciate his help on finding the conference site and the bus stop of the airport express bus.  The room is nice and quite and well air-conditioned.\n",
            "- It was a completely depleting experience. What with no place to park, no house number or entrance visable I was grateful that someone finally appeared and let me in. Jackie went w/me to help me retrieve my car and squeez into a space up and around. But that's Boston as far as parking goes. The room was as expected and the bed OK. Would have appreciated a glass of water or even a glass. But after all I was glad to be there for that one night. \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "- It is amazing for me to leave in Robert's house for a 3-day trip in boston.  It is a house with enough sunshine! And the host is very good!\n",
            "- Robert was friendly and easygoing. Room was comfortable, air conditioned, and conveniently located!\n",
            "- Great location, really in the heart of the city and walkable from all of the key areas.  The room was clean and the house was really quiet.  Robert provided me with a key to come and go which was great, and gave me a run down of the area and some really useful local insider info.\n",
            "- Overall Perfect! I texted Robert when I arrived and JaiQi came out to open the door for me. JaiQi was so nice, he showed me the house, explained how everything worked and he also gave me a map of the city and recommended me cool places and activities. He also surprised me with a free ticket to the art museum, which was great because I was planing to go, so I save money there to eat more lobster lol. My room was exactly as pictured. Room and bathroom were clean at all times. House and neighborhood were quiet. The location was so convenient, just a 4 minute walk to the T line.  I will stay here again :)\n",
            "- Great place to stay. It's in a quite section of town that is within walking distance to all of the historical sites in town. \n",
            "- Robert's place is really cool - a neat old brownstone in the heart of Back Bay.  It's incredibly convenient to Back Bay and a great neighborhood for restaurants and shopping.  Getting into the house was simple, and everything was as described.  I'd definitely stay there again!\n",
            "- Logement ok dans l'ensemble.\n",
            "- Very friendly! Would stay again. \n",
            "- Excellent location for Back Bay Amtrak station. Big room, big shared bathroom, good shower water pressure, and decent wifi. Host and assistant were very nice, super responsive, and had a nice system set up. \n",
            "- Robert's brownstone is on a reasonably quiet residential street, well located three or four blocks from Copley Square. The room was large and quiet. Robert told me about the awesome Back Bay Logan Express, which runs between the airport and Copley Square for only $5. I borrowed a book during my visit called 'The Edwardians' that was pretty inteeresting. I was able to walk to Hynes Convention Center, even Fenway Park and downtown because everything is so compressed. Local eateries were a little high for my taste, I am more into hole-in-the-wall falafel joints, but there is a Star Market nearby. I would stay here again.\n",
            "- We really enjoyed our stay.  The bedroom was beautiful, and we loved the windows in the room!  This bedroom is in a lovely brownstone in a wonderful neighborhood with lots of other beautiful homes, so it was a pleasure to stay here and walk back to our place after a day out and about.  It was also very convenient to most of the sight-seeing we did, so it was easy to pop back in mid-day to grab a sweater.  There are a couple of subway stations very nearby, so that was nice, but there was a lot of wonderful stuff to do within walking distance.  Couldn't have really chosen a better neighborhood for our stay!  Robert and Jackie were wonderful hosts, very accommodating and friendly.  Jackie carried our suitcase to and from room for us, and talked to us a little bit about the house.  Robert was helpful with suggestions of things to do while we were in town.  Our only regret is that we didn't have more time.  We were busy every second of our stay, and there was still so much more we wanted to do and see.  If you've never been to Boston, but are a student or just lover of architectural history, you'll feel like a kid in a candy store.  Make sure to check out the blocks-and-blocks-long park running along the center of Commonwealth Ave called the Commonwealth Mall, lined with the most magnificent houses, just a few blocks away.  You can start at the Boston Public Garden and continue along this stretch for a really lovely walk.\n",
            "- Robert greeted me and gave a great orientation to the neighborhood and logistics of getting around.  Was a great location to launch into the activities we had going on around Copley area.\n",
            "- This airbnb was perfect for me while I attended a medical convention. The photos and descriptions are right on target. It's in a great location. I would recommend.\n",
            "- I was quite disappointed in my stay at Robert's home home. My bedroom had a comfy bed, but there were no drawers to put my clothes in both closets were stuffed with boxes and paper. There were 10\" of space but no hangers to hang clothing on. I did get hangers when I requested them from his assistant. The TV was 15\" square and the remote did not work. There were no locks on any of the five guest bedrooms and only one working smoke detector that I could find on the four floors of the home. No one could enter the front door because it was packed with stuff so everyone had to enter from the little door under the stairs. I was most dismayed with the kitchen which was filthy unusable, and all surfaces were covered with stuff including the stove. I asked for some Kleenex for my room and I was given a roll of toilet paper. Someone tried to enter my room in the middle of the night and I yelled & they left. I shared the bathroom with two other people    As mentioned in the other reviews, the house and hall walls were filled with stacks of books. After two nights I just couldn't stay there anymore and abandoned my third night reservation. I called and emailed Robert to get him to try to rent my third night but I never heard back from him. \n",
            "- Robert was really kind! I got the best history lesson about a city especially Boston in this case ever. He recommended me a lot of nice places and how to get there. The room was perfect, quiet and also big. There's more than everything you will need in there. I will try to stay there again in the future. Great distance to shops, bars and as well the train station! Thanks Robert for the Boston experience and see you soon :)\n",
            "- Great place!! The room was nice and quiet. Fast internet connection, which was nice for getting work done. Robert was very helpful with some \"logistic\" issues - on the first day, I needed to drop my stuff off a little early and on the last day, I had a 6am flight out and public transport doesn't run early enough to get to the airport. He also told me about a special event at the MFA.\n",
            "- This was an absolutely lovely little room. I was in town for a conference and I really appreciated the small work space/desk. Neighborhood is quiet and was a great location. I'd definitely use this airbnb again. \n",
            "- This room is an old traditional brick house with lots of character. There are two flights of steep stairs to reach it. it is very confortable and cosy, well adapted to not only sleep but also work (the table is big enough). Wi-fi is adequate if erratic but apparently this is the standard in Boston. Robert is very friendly and would have gladly given me lots of good advice, had I needed or wanted it. Location is great if you want to go to the Hynes convention center or Back Bay, which was my case.\n",
            "- This house is great! I like its atmosphere. I could not meet Robert, but he contacted me kindly and let me easily get into the house.(his roommate helped me) Neighber is quiet, so I could have a good sleep. I really recommend this house!\n",
            "- Pro.f Robert is a kind man. He likes to talk with his guests. He introduced a lot about the history of Boston and recommended which places should be visited. His house is very nice and the location is perfect. His assistant is also a kind man too. We became friend and drunk before I left. Thanks a lot!\n",
            "- it is a nice place\n",
            "- It was a great stay, as always. I look forward to the next one. \n",
            "- I've stayed here 4 times now. It was great as always.\n",
            "- This is the fifth time I've stayed here. It was great as always :) Looking forward to the next one.\n",
            "- I I had a pleasant stay at Robert's place and would highly recommend it. \n",
            "- 非常好!位置超赞,房间宽敞,Robert 也为我们的行程热心的提供了不少建议,他的助手Jacky也非常帮忙。性价比不错,值得推荐!\n",
            "- This is a great space full of books that is great for people who do not work at night--the internet goes on and off at night and was inconsistent even after I asked it to be left on. The bathroom is upstairs. If you are a neat freak, you might find it sort of dirty. I consider myself as having about average hygiene expectations, and was very comfortable.\n",
            "- A typical Bostonian house filled with history, conveniently located and with a cozy friendly atmosphere. I stayed there for the Boston marathon and it fully fulfilled my expectations.\n",
            "- Robert's place is more hostel than airbnb. Good location and place to crash when in a pinch. Robert is very nice!\n",
            "- Rober is a complete gentleman and I loved being in such centric location.\n",
            "- Quiet room in a quiet neighborhood, convenient to everything I needed to do.  The quirkiness of all the books makes it feel human!\n",
            "- バックベイの駅からもすぐでしたし、どこへ出かけるのにも便利な所でした。静かで 落ち着いた環境で 心ゆくまでボストンを楽しめました。ロバートさんの知的なお人柄にも救われました。\n",
            "- Nice place. Very accommodating and helpful. We will be back if we are ever in the area again!\n",
            "- This is a fantastic property in middle of a quiet neighborhood not far from anything I wanted to do while in Boston. I was in Boston for a conference at the Hynes Convention Center which was only about a 10 minute walk which was very convenient. The T stop (and Amtrak) is also only 2 blocks away so it was really easy getting there from the airport and leaving on the Amtrak to go to New York. The place was very clean and the all of the books made it feel very cozy. The posting is very accurate with its description and pictures. Unfortunately Robert was on vacation so I wasn't able to meet him, but his friend greeted me when I got there and provided me with a map of the city and recommendations for things to see. I felt very welcome. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Boston!\n",
            "- I could spent in the nice neighborhood  \" Back Bay\" during staying in Boston.  The place is very convenient place for visitors.  To spend the old house is interesting. It would be better I could use drawers to keep my clothes.  Also Wi-Fi speed is slow.\n",
            "- Listing description is accurate. Great location! Robert was very friendly.\n",
            "- Electric place wirh old school feeling. Host could not be nicer and not location is AAA. Lots of stairs but would stay again. In a heartbeat \n",
            "- Beautiful room, historic but well maintained room. I loved the vintage books, old furniture, the view from my bedroom and the convenience of the location. Robert was also extremely accommodating of my checking in and checking out.\n",
            "- Although we didn't meet Robert, his assistant gave us warm welcome and told us the attractions nearby.  Robert's house is very clean and the location is very convenient, where can go anywhere by foot and takes few minutes to subway. If I come to Boston again I will still stay his house.  \n",
            "- The listing was exactly as described. The house and decor are historic. It is a little cluttered, but also clean and orderly. The mattress is very comfortable. The location is great. The shared bathroom was kept very clean. The house was very quiet throughout my 3 night stay. Robert was excellent with communication before and during the stay. \n",
            "- Everything is as advertised on the listing. Robert's assistant greeted me. He was very nice. He gave lots of info about the transportation and neighbourhoods around. Great location. \n",
            "- Brooke was a fantastic host, she gave my a synopsis of everything to do, was very active in making sure I was taken care of for my trip and the neighbor hood is bar none! I would stay and recommend everyone to stay here!! \n",
            "- We had a great weekend at Brooke's flat in back bay.  The space was comfortable with everything you could need and the location was fantastic.  Brooke was very helpful and flexible.  She had her cleaner come early so we could get a few hours bit before check in.  She communicated and got back to us quickly with questions.  There was a bit of noise on Saturday night, but that is what you get with any location like this -- right in the heart of everything.  We would definitely stay at Brooke's again.  \n",
            "- The Apartment is great and as described in the web. The location is excellent, with lots of cafes and restaurants around (Do not miss the Select Oyster Bar!). Brooke was very flexible with the requests I made and always checking if everything was OK. Definitively, I will choose this Apt for my new visit. Thanks Brooke!\n",
            "- We absolutely loved Brooke's apartment and she was so helpful with restaurant recommendations and fun things to do around town. The apartment was immaculate and just wonderful. Perfect location to shops, Fenway and right in the heart of Back Bay. \n",
            "- Convenient location for getting anywhere in the city. A shoppers paradise. Brooke was very organized and made our stay easy and enjoyable.\n",
            "- Brooke was a pleasure to work with and was very communicative. Her apartment is in the perfect location and is very well put together for such a small space. Would def recommend! \n",
            "- We enjoyed our two nights in the apartment.  The location was great, as it was right in the middle of Newbury Street so we were within walking distance of many restaurant and shops.  The subway was a short walk.  The apartment itself was exactly as advertised.  When we arrived it was clean and neat.   The kitchen included plates, utensils, glassware, pots, etc. We made use of the cable TV and WIFI.  I definitely recommend staying here.\n",
            "- Brooke's apartment is clean, comfortable and a thoroughly enjoyable place to stay. It exactly matches the pictures online and the location is one of the best, right on Newbury Street with plenty of shops and restaurants on the doorstep. I enjoyed every day of my month long stay. Brooke is an excellent host, she's responsive and simply keen to help wherever possible. I've stayed in many airbnb's and this is one of my favorites. I have no hesitation in recommending this apartment.\n",
            "- Brooke was very helpful prior to our arrival. She provided a list of bars and restaurants which helped us during our stay. The apartment was in a great location, walking distance to everything. We arrived and departed with late flights and Brooke was extra accommodating. Would recommend highly!\n",
            "- The place was a described. The place was clean. Comfortable. It was a great place to stay. Perfect for those attending things at Hynes. Newbury Street is vibrant. Brooke's suggestions for food and drink were spot on. Best coffee at Wired Puppy. \n",
            "- Brooke was a great host - really informative and happy to give suggestions about where to go and what to see. The apartment is lovely and couldn't be in a better location - very central and near all sorts of nice cafes and restaurants and a 5 minute walk to the river front. Despite the central location, we didn't have any trouble with noise. If I go to Boston again, I will definitely be seeing if this place is available. Thanks Brooke! \n",
            "- Brooke was beyond accommodating. She arranged for us to have an early check-in, and then texted us on the first night to make sure we didn't need anything. The apartment itself lived up to the description online. It was clean, comfortable, and ideally located in Boston. My husband and I walked to Red Sox games and numerous restaurants from the apartment :)\n",
            "- Wonderful stay! This was a very cute, comfortable apartment in an incredible area. Brooke's cleaner met us with the key when we arrived somewhat late. We did a little cooking in the well stocked kitchen but mostly ate at nearby restaurants (great Italian cuisine downstairs!). An easy walk to Boston Commons, downtown, North End and South End. I highly recommend a stay in Brooke's apartment. Compared to local hotels, this is a fantastic value.\n",
            "- This was one of my first Airbnb experiences and it has set the bar supremely high.  The apartment was adorable, amazingly located, and had everything I needed.  Brooke was communicative, accommodating to my arrival and departure requests, and just overall super helpful.  I had a terrific stay and was sad when it was time to leave.\n",
            "- This was my second stay at Brooke's apartment and it was every bit as good as the first, in every respect. A great apartment, in a great location with a truly lovely host. This is one of my favorites!\n",

Her apartment was absolutely beautiful and location was perfect. Highly recommend staying here!!!\n",
            "- Brooke was a great host and her studio apartment is quaint, thoughtfully appointed and well-located. Whether you want to kick back and relax, shop on Newbury St, or explore Back Bay, this is a lovely little home away from home! Brooke is a great host and was in communication with us at check-in and during our stay, to check on our needs. Thanks for sharing it with us, Brooke!  ( :\n",

            "- A very welcoming stay! Lorna was very understanding of our late arrival as we arrived after a red sox game. A beautiful house and room to stay in with everything you need and spacious at that. Lorna was a great host, very kind and interactive. We loved the city and the games we went to (lucked out and were able to get front row green monster seats for the bosox/baseball fans) we definitely plan on making a longer trip to see more next time, and you can bet we'll be staying with Lorna again!\n",
            "- I had a very nice experience at Lorna's Retreat.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Lorna and her husband Rob were friendly and accommodating.  Rob is an Uber and Lyft driver so we were able to organize my pick up at the airport for a reasonable rate.   The location is away from downtown Boston but it is easy enough to go back and forth by public transportation.   \n",
            "- Lorna was not very sensitive of our late arrival. We were traveling far and came to move my daughter out of her dorm room and I felt extremely pressured to arrive early due to the constant contact from her. In addition to this she was upset about us bringing more than two people despite us having rented both rooms and asked for specific permission to bring a blow up mattress which she had originally accepted.\n",
            "- Our experience was amazing! Lorna was very professional and caring. She responded to my messages in a timely manner. The home was clean and cozy. The room was organized and all amenities were in good condition. It was quiet and peaceful. I highly recommend this space to anyone who looking for a good Airbnb place. \n",
            "- Lorna was a great host. There was no trouble getting into our accommodation, and when we arrived, we had a choice of which room we wanted! There was a kitchen and a porch too, and our room was nice, though a bit stuffy. The bathroom was clean and good too. There was also a cat! Anyway, we very greatly enjoyed our stay. One should note that it is a bit far from central Boston, though Uber is really cheap to the city center from here. Lorna was also very quick to respond to all my questions ever since I started asking her about her listing (even before booking with her). Great accommodation at a great price, would recommend!\n",
            "- Lorna was a very nice host to us. She was very communicative while I was inquiring about the property and extremely courteous when we were checking-in. We were driving down from Montreal and got delayed due to 4th of July traffic. I reached past midnight which most of the airbnb hosts won't be okay with (reaching at 8pm has been too late in some of thre Airbnbs I stayed in the past.) but she welcomed us with a smile.\n",

            "A great value for the price. \n",
            "- Simply put, Ms. Lorna and her family did a great job of hosting me. Not only were they hospitable and accommodating, but they also made sure to educate me in regards to how to best prepare myself for my move to Boston. Literally every single question I had was answered and then some! Now, in regards to this house and its many amenities, I found both to be on par with what was described. I highly recommend this facility for anyone looking for a \"home away from home\" while in the Boston area!\n",

The apartment itself is really nice, and only a ten minute walk to the nearest T station. No free parking which was the only problem, as the nearby parking station was $30 a day! But other than that great place to stay. Thanks guys!\n",
            "- We had a great time in Boston. The check in was easy. Gisele reached out to me to ask what time we will arrive. When she greeted us, she left muni pass, and magazines about Boston as well as she came up with some recommendations of what to do, where to eat and park the car. Her apartment  is very clean and close to public transportation, however, Lyft or Uber was only $8 from downtown. \n",
            "- Well Giesel was nice host .She coordinated well. The only thing annoying was check out time was 11 and they have asked us to clean the rroomby 9 am morning and asked us to come in living room for that period so that was little bit annoying . Rest the location is great \n",

            " You may need to ask about what you can and cannot use (sugar, fridge space, microwave, etc...) I would stay here again!\n",
            "- We enjoyed our stay at Gisel's place. The place was as described close to downtown. We had some trouble finding parking nearby but that is expected in Boston. The neighborhood appeared to be safe. The bed was comfortable and their place very clean. They even offered us lemon bars for breakfast. We will definitely consider staying here again.\n",
            "- Gisel and Craig were very welcoming and the room was very nice. I thought it would be difficult to stay in an apartment with another couple, but that was not the case.  I highly recommend staying with Gisel.\n",

The room was cozy and the house was well decorated, and super conveniently located. Both hosts were super sweet and accommodating. Thanks y'all!\n",
            "- Gisel was a great host! My boyfriend and I did not know what to expect and were not sure about the shared living space, however it worked out well. We had our own space and rarely ran in to each other or heard them.  The apartment was beautiful and very clean. Gisel offered us blueberry muffins one morning, which was a great treat. It was located about 20 min transit ride from downtown, but there were a few restaurants and shops near by as well. Parking was our main issue, but there was a pay parking down the street and Sundays were free on the street. Overall, we had a great time and I would recommend this place! \n",

I had a hard time locating a lock box combo and the unit and was not sure if I was at the right place - host did text back to help navigate me through these (URL HIDDEN) was a bit of a scavenger hunt and also the living condition was 3 bedrooms with a single bathroom - reminded me of a hostel.

Be prepared for a hike to the house and the ability to conquer many flights of granite steps and interior narrow, windy stairs with luggage. Be aware of the activity on the street when walking. \n",

Kitchen was well-stocked with cookware and plates. Huge dining room and family room for big groups to convene. Would absolutely book again. \n",
            "- This house made our trip to Boston to run the marathon very easy. The house was actually more spacious than I expected with enough bedroom space for all eight of us plus a large enough kitchen and living room for us all to hang out. The proximity to the orange line allowed us to easily get places like the Hynes Convention Center for the race expo, the Boston Commons race morning and all the sightseeing we wanted to do including getting to Fenway Park for a Red Sox game. Also, there was a small park down the street where we could get a little jogging in the days before the race. Helder allowed us to arrive before the official 2:00 P.M. check in and seemed very flexible. I would definitely consider staying in this house with a large group again.\n",
            "- The house was clean and well prepared for our group. We had plenty of space and the owners were extremely gracious with their accommodations. We were grateful for the detailed list of nearby restaurants and hot spots. It was nice to come back after a long day and be able to spread out, relax and get a good night's sleep. Thank you very much for opening up your home.\n",

            "\n",
            "The apartment I originally booked had a water leak a couple of days before our arrival. Kama has thus set us up with an even better apartment closer to the city. The place we ended up staying at was wonderful and very well organized as well as practical.\n",

            "- This was my first time using Airbnb.  Kama called to make sure we didn't have any trouble getting into the apartment, and also checked in during the week to make sure everything was going well.  She answered all my questions about the area.  The apartment was very clean.  It's in a great location with a bus stop right out front and within a 10 minute walk to the B,C,& D train lines. There's a coffee shop and restaurants right across the street.\n",

She checked in with us to make sure everything was going well, and was quick to respond. \n",
            "- Kama had everything ready for our stay. We had troubles getting into the lock box but she answered our call and was extremely helpful. There was a great gift basket with water and snacks. The location was convenient for our needs. The beds were very comfortable and the listing was accurate. We had a great stay!\n",
            "- Everything was good and as expected. Place is nice. I found all, that I needed. Thank you,  Kama.\n",
            "- Kama's description was everything to be hoped for.  The location was easily accessible and parking plentiful.  We had no trouble getting there, accessing the apartment and checking out.  We were late arrivers and early departers and the process was smooth and unobtrusive.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice quiet stay.  The only thing I would caution is that the apt is a bit small so if you have four people and do not share the bed it is a bit crowded.\n",
            "- The apt on Chestnut Hill was the perfect location for our trip.  once I found street parking getting around via the T and Iber was so convenient.  The apt is not large (I'd say 3 adults with luggage for extended international travel is capacity) but it is clean and has all the conveniences of home.\n",

            "\n",
            "My biggest concern is that this unit is clearly a nice studio apartment that has been taken off the market and re-purposed for use as a full-time rental unit, which contributes to Boston's housing shortage. I didn't fully realize it when I booked the unit, but it's not the model of AirBnB spaces that I personally wish to support. \n",
            "- Perfect for a weekend stay in Boston. \n",
            "- Kama was amazing. Easy to get a hold of- had everything written up at the studio along with info about the neighborhood and how to use the green line. The studio was perfect and I loved my stay in Boston. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone!!!\n",
            "- I really enjoyed my stay here at Kama's. Kama was really nice and helpful, I had some difficulties on how to get the key when I first arrived there.

She had lots of great suggestions for activities and places to eat and she surprised us by lending us a picnic blanket and sunscreen. Our bedroom was bright, clean, and decorated with care. We also had access to a fully equipped kitchen, a cozy living room, and a nice patio in the back. Overall, the house has a lot of character. We really appreciated the array of breakfast foods that Cynthia offered and we took full advantage of the interesting restaurants within walking distance. The house is quite close to the train station so we explored the city with ease. I would highly recommend staying here. \n",

Apart from Cynthia being a great host, her house was really well located (close by the subway station) and also had easy and free parking in the premises which helped a lot. She also accommodated us for a late check-in. Staying at her place made our Boston experience even better, would definitely recommend and would be back. \n",
            "- Cynthia is a great host, super organised, very welcoming but let's you get on with your own thing while your staying with her.

The room is spacious, the housemates are lovely - I was horrendously sick most of my time there and one of Johannes housemates picked some stuff up from the pharmacy for me. The room, bathroom, and kitchen are very clean. I only regret that I didn't really get to meet everyone there properly, but that was the fault of my food poisoning.\n",

            "- Victor and his girlfriend, Galina, made us feel very welcomed.  She greeted us as soon as we arrived to the apartment, and even had refreshments waiting for us! The apartment is exactly as pictured, so there were no surprises there. What was surprising, was that it's on the 4th floor. There is an elevator in the building; it's a little frightening, but that's just because we are not used to old elevators.\n",
            "\n",
            "The location was perfect. A block away is one of the busiest streets in Boston, and there was a ton of nightlife, and lots of great places to eat. It's also a stone's throw away from Fenway Park, and while we were there, the Foo Fighters were playing, so we were able to hear them while walking around.\n",

Yi even helped me print something last minute the next morning!  I could not give this place a more positive review.\n",
            "- Yi is a friendly guy. If I had any questions or if I had to contact him, he replied within minutes. He made the move in process really simple, and gave me a tour of the whole apartment. The apartment was perfectly clean, I don't think I could find a speck of dust if I tried. \n",

            "\n",
            "- Joe was timely with communications.  The setup is great as a crash pad if you just need a place to lay your head down.  I was unclear on the fact the bathroom was communal between a few rooms—but it was no real problem as I saw no trace of other guests while I was there.  Everything was clean.\n",
            "- The room was perfect for a one night stay before I moved on to the HBS campus. Joe was extremely cooperative and took time to answer all my queries.

            "- Joe is nice. The house is close to Harvard and the room is comfortable. But my neighbor sometimes made some noise by talking to his phone loudly after 10:30 pm. Another thing I have to mention is the trash bin had never been emptied in the bathroom, though it was already full, since I moved in. Fortunately, except that, the bathroom was clean. Overall, the experience is good.\n",
            "- Joe was very nice. The heater is the room was wonderful as it was cold when my friend and I visited. It is a very pretty room that was perfect for our trip. Very happy with choosing Joe and would 100% recommend him.\n",

            "- Staying at Joe's for a short period of time was great. It is out of busy downtown Boston, but luckily we got a T-pass to get around. Access to public transportation in Boston is great, and from the house to the bus is only a short walk. The listing is accurate, however, one thing I'd want to note is that the common areas in the house are cool (i.e. washrooms, kitchen, halls). We had a heater in our room, which kept us warm, but pack some slippers and extra sweaters if you're the type of person who gets cold. Other than that, staying here was good. Although there were other guests, we never had an issue with using the bathroom or kitchen area- it's as if we were on our own. \n",

            "- Joe was a great host. The room was clean and welcoming. Bed was very comfortable. It's a nice space to have to yourself as well, since this has more a feel of a boarding house with others there who are renting rooms or using Airbnb. The location was pretty good as well, with easy bus access to Cambridge and the train to get around the city. \n",
            "- Quiet, clean, and convenient. The place is as described. Roommates are friendly and considerate. A great home base to knock out a bit of work and attend meetings near Harvard. Joe made it easy for me to check in even though I arrived after midnight.\n",

            "- Joe y su mujer son encantadores. La habitación es cómoda y limpia y su ubicación es perfecta para la HBS. También está muy bien conectada con Harvard Square. Además, si lo pides Joe te puede recoger y llevar al aeropuerto a un precio muy razonable. Lo recomiendo totalmente.\n",
            "- Joe was on his way to Jamaica to be married! on the last day of my three-day stay, and he still made sure that I was comfortable and asked if I needed anything. I attended a conference in Cambridge and walked the mile down and back on N. Harvard St. to the campus each day--no problems whatsoever. I could have taken the bus if I had needed to. Joe's AirBNB is clean, secure, and properly fitted with kitchen and bathroom facilities--all fine. I agree with the other reviewers that for the price and location you are getting a bargain. The neighborhood is an old one, but I always felt safe, with a lot of students, tourists, and working class families. Parking at Joe's is plentiful. Congratulations on your marriage!\n",
            "- The room was very clean as were the bathrooms and kitchen. The bed was also very comfortable. Bathrooms featured shampoo and body was for public use which was a plus along with good wifi and air conditioning. The neighborhood was safe and populated with many students. Conveniently located about a mile from Harvard and Boston University. Many great places too eat are also a 10~ minute walk from the room. Joe was also very helpful in returning an earring to me that I had left in the room. Would definitely stay again.\n",
            "- Staying in Lower Allston at Joe and Nancy's place was fantastic! I am a medical student and was studying at the Massachusetts General Hospital for 6 weeks so it was really important for me to find a place that was clean, private, comfortable, safe and friendly with easy access to Harvard Square/ the red line/ the hospital. Joe's place provided all of this and more! \n",
            "\n",
            "The room was spacious and clean with air conditioning and a heater. I had easy access to all the facilities I needed including a fully equipped kitchen, laundry facilities and 2 bathrooms. Joe went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed and went out and bought an ironing board when I asked if one was available for me to iron my shirts with! All the guests that stayed during my 6 weeks were also respectful and friendly which made my trip even better. \n",
            "\n",
            "The house is in a pleasant residential area which is quiet at night time but close to all important amenities. The nearest supermarket was only 10 minutes walk away and the number 66 bus route had a stop at the top of the road and had a regular service every 5-10 minutes which took me into Harvard Square within 10 minutes. \n",
            "\n",
            "Between my excellent hosts and the fantastic location I felt completely at home during my stay and would recommend Joe's place to anyone looking visit Boston without paying the ridiculous price of downtown hotels. It was an absolute pleasure to get to know him and his wife Nancy and I hope they stay in touch in the future. I wish you both all the best! \n",
            "- The room itself and the aprtment were very clean. Joe provided many amenities such as shampoo and towels. Overall I'm very pleased!\n"
